Three months ago, I learned of my Uncle's passing. We weren't particularly close but he left me one of his houses in the will. I was touched but just wanted to sell it off. I am a fairly new father of twin girls and didn't need another thing to manage right now.

To speed up the process, I decided to travel across the country to live in the house until a sale was assured. My job just requires a laptop and phone so I was approved to work remotely for the time being. Unfortunately, my wife had to stay at her job so I had to come alone.

At first, I treated it as a mini-vacation. I had hoped it would only last a week but the process was more involved than I thought. I had a realtor taking care of most things but, after a month, I'm still here.

I noticed things going wrong right away. Stuff was never where I last placed it. I'd see shadows out of the corner of my eye. I've lose track of time constantly.

I thought it was caused by stress. Loneliness. Except for the few times the Realtor came by with prospective buyers, the house was the quietest place I had ever been in.

Before I completely lost my mind, the neighbor came by with a dog. She was an elderly woman who explained that she had been dog-sitting while my Uncle was in the hospital. Now that I was here, she thought I should take Buster, the golden retriever.

I thought the neighbor might have been "forgetful" because she seemed to think my Uncle had just passed last week. Either way, I fell in love with Buster and his presence was exactly what I needed. I even thought it would be a tremendous present to bring home to my girls. I just hoped my wife would feel the same way.

However, even the dog could tell something was wrong with the house. Buster accepted his new living arrangements pretty quickly but would never willingly go upstairs. This was alright with me at the time. I thought it would make it easier to keep track of him.

Then, Buster disappeared.

Literally, one second he was standing right behind me as I was opening the treat jar to give him a snack. My eyes left him for just a moment to put the jar back and then he was gone.

I ran through the whole house calling his name. The kitchen was connected to the living room and on the other end of that was the master bedroom and study. The other end of the kitchen led to a dining room which was connected to the entrance hall that also led into the living room and stairs to the second floor.

After walking upstairs, you had a choice of right or left along a balcony that overlooked the living room on one side and entrance on the other. Going left led immediately to a guest room and game room.

Going right led to two more guest rooms and a bathroom at the end of the hall. I looked in every room and had to accept that somehow the dog made it outside, even though there was no doggy door and every door and window had been closed and locked.

So I searched the surrounding neighborhood for another hour before giving up. I was thinking about making flyers when I opened the front door and heard Buster scrambling towards me from the kitchen.

I was ecstatic of course but I just couldn't wrap my head around how I could have missed him. I let Buster sleep in the bed with me that night. In hindsight, it was a huge mistake but it made me feel better at the time.

Things picked up at work though and I soon forgot about all the strangeness surrounding this house. Clients called me constantly but we were getting a lot done and I landed multiple large contracts in a row. I was working around the clock but I knew I'd be due a promotion once I returned to the home office.

Several times I'd get lost in a phone call or spreadsheet and suddenly find that it was nighttime. I'd be so absorbed with work that I would block out Buster whining for food or to go outside. I started to set alarms to keep track but I had too many important clients to slow down.

I was on top of the world but my health was starting to suffer. I'd forget to eat and even sleep sometimes. There was always something else to do or someone to talk to. I even got better at taking care of Buster, better than I was taking care of myself at least.

Then my good mood ended with a bang. Literally. Buster was whining behind me as I finished another spreadsheet. Then we both heard a door slam upstairs.

For the first time since I brought him inside, Buster ran upstairs by himself. I almost called the cops but I felt silly with the phone in my hand. I started to doubt I had heard anything at all.

And if there were an intruder, surely Buster would have been making more noise. So I mustered all the courage I could manage and crept upstairs with frying pan as my weapon.

It was dark upstairs but enough moonlight was coming in from the downstairs windows for me to make out Buster standing in front of the bathroom. I had purposely closed every door when I last came through here looking for the lost dog but this door was now wide open.

I flipped on the hallway light but nothing happened. With no better ideas, I raised my frying pan high and walked slowly to the bathroom. There was no window in here so it was pure darkness inside.

I was terrified.

Bizarrely, Buster just looked frozen. His tail stood straight up and he just stood there pointed towards the door. I tried to take it as a good sign that he still wasn't barking. That's what finally got me through the threshold and into the bathroom.

The whole time my eyes had been getting used to the darkness and the bathroom was too small for there to have been anyone there without me noticing. I started to relax when I took a step forward into something sticky.

I suddenly realized that I had my cell phone in my pocket. I pulled it out and turned it on to cast some light on the floor. I immediately dropped it at the sight of the bright red liquid that surrounded my feet.

I fled the upstairs and this triggered Buster to follow. This time I had no trouble calling the police. Thankfully, there was already a patrol car nearby so two officers arrived within a couple of minutes.

Their powerful flashlights cut through the darkness like knives but they soon found nothing was wrong with the upstairs lights. Something did appear to be wrong with my pipes though as they called out from above that the puddle was just rusty water.

Because of their insistence, I climbed up the stairs again and clearly saw a muddy brown puddle in the bathroom. The banging must have been from a pipe breaking. Both cops had a laugh at my expense but were otherwise understanding.

They even gave me a number of good plumber though my cell phone was ruined after I dropped, and left, it in the puddle. I would have to use the one landline in the kitchen from now on.

I let them out and promised to call the plumber first thing in the morning. Yet, as exhausted as I was, I couldn't go to sleep over that excitement so I stayed up to draft some more important documents for my company.

Before I knew it, Buster had made another mess in the living room. I was dead tired and said somethings to Buster that maybe I shouldn't have and I did some things to him that I know I really shouldn't have.

I decided to do something about the stress I had been under and I spoke to my supervisor that same morning. To my surprise, they were happy to let me have the week off as a sort of mental vacation. Just like that, all my outstanding work was taken away.

With nothing else to do, I tried to focus on Buster. I played games with him and fed him a bunch of treats to make up for my earlier neglect.

Then I found the first message.

I didn't notice it for some time since I had been avoiding the second floor. But I realized that I hadn't actually called the plumber. Before doing so, I went upstairs to see if things had gotten any worse.

Instead, I immediately saw a message written in red on the hallway wall. It read, "Losing your mind?"

For a second, I kinda did. I was scared to death at the thought that someone had to have sneaked into my house while I was there. Probably when I was sleeping.

I won't bear repeating everything I said or did right after, let's just say I hadn't become any braver since the banging. Eventually, I unlocked my bedroom door and made my way to the kitchen with Buster leading the way.

I called the police again. Those same two officers were able to show up and then, slowly, we cleared every inch of the house. Yet, we found no one. Everything was locked. No sign of forced entry.

The police actually took me seriously, something that bewildered me at the time, and admitted that this isn't the first house in this neighborhood to experience this. There had been a series of break-ins where nothing was stolen but the police officers still offered to have a car sit outside for the night.

Even though I took them up on this, I soon realized that I'd never get to sleep tonight in this house. So I called my only friend in town, and really in the whole state, an old college roommate who coincidentally lived 30 minutes away.

He offered to pick me and Buster up in a few hours so I busied myself with packing up my suitcase. I didn't know how long I would need so I pretty much packed everything I had brought with me to the house in the first place.

I left my room to pick up some doggy toys when my friend called to say he was waiting outside. I decided to hang up the phone and meet him immediately. I needed the human company and he could help me move my stuff.

But the driveway was empty. There was no friend, no car. I called him back immediately and he insisted he was outside. I listened to him get out of his car and walk up to the front door. He knocked and I could hear the door open and an elderly woman greet him.

My friend asked for my name and mentioned my Uncle. The woman said she had never heard of either of us. After thanking her, my friend left and asked me if I had gotten all that. I told him I must have given him the wrong address. He rattled off the correct one and confirmed he was there.

After asking him to wait and I left the house again. I walked out to the street and looked back at the numbers written on the curb and on the mailbox. Only there weren't any numbers. Just a message, "Losing your mind?" on the curb. Written in red.

The temptation to leave right away was great. I could just start walking and never stop. But I had to get my stuff and, more importantly, Buster so I entered the house one last time. When I came back to the room, my suitcase was empty. Everything I had just spent the last hour packing up was back in its' proper place.

Despite how impossible this was, I focused on only one goal. We needed to leave. I put a leash on Buster and was shocked to see how haggard he was. I resolved to make it up to him when this was all over.

I tried to leave out the front door like nothing was wrong but I couldn't open it. The knob turned freely but the deadbolt wouldn't slide back. I was really scared now but Buster's presence helped. I knelt down to give him a hug and he gave me an idea while licking my face.

Whatever was happening, it sure wasn't the result of a maniac hiding in my house. Still, I didn't know what forces were actually opposing me so I walked to the backyard and said loudly, "Well, Buster, time for a little walk!"

The glass door slid open easily.

Buster bounded out happily. I guess it had been a long time since I let him outside. I followed more tentatively and, for the first time, examined the backyard closely. There was a iron fence surrounding the yard with another space between the bars that Buster could slip through.

And then I saw it. A tree that grew too close to the fence and had several branches extending through and above it. I assumed the gate would be supernaturally locked too so this was my exit.

Buster didn't need any prodding. He waited patiently for me on the other side as I painfully pulled myself up and over the fence. I was suddenly aware of how weak and tired my recent lifestyle had made me.

When I was in the process of climbing down the tree on the other side, Buster growled once and then took off like a shot, towards a nearby hill. I jumped down and gave chase.

He disappeared over the top and I scrambled to keep up on the surprisingly steep surface. Luckily, I found where someone had laid some stone bricks into the side for an easier way up.

It was still steep enough that I had to focus on placing my feet correctly to keep from sliding so I was looking down when my next reach up resulted in my hand grabbing carpet.

Confused, I looked up see the second floor landing. I looked down to see the rest of the stairs that led to the entrance hall and living room of the house. Buster was nowhere to be found.

Demoralized and dead tired, I crawled the final steps and just sat on the landing for awhile, occasionally calling for Buster. Eventually, the kitchen phone rang.

Whatever ghosts were messing with me, I realized they couldn't stop outside forces from helping. I tumbled down the stairs in my haste and landed hard on the cold tiles below. But I was only dazed for second and soon was in the kitchen with the phone in my hand.

My wife's warm voice filled me with hope. She was concerned that she hadn't heard from me in awhile. I couldn't recall the last time I had even tried.

She was trying to tell me that my work hadn't heard from me in a week while I tried to tell her to call the police. Her words gave me pause though.

I asked, "What do you mean? I was given the week off?"

"Dear? I thought you were supposed to continue working as soon as you got there."

"Uh, yeah but they gave me a week off because of all the stress I've been under. Wait a second. How long have I been out here?"

"Honey, you've been gone almost 9 days now."

My stomach sunk but I didn't hesitate to say, "Listen, you need to call the cops. Something is wrong. I think I'm having a medical emergency."

I had just been trying to come up with an excuse to limit the amount of follow up questions but I ended up realizing that this was actually the most likely explanation.

Maybe I was just suffering from a gas leak or brain tumor. Ironically, either of those options seemed preferable than living in a haunted house.

My wife asked, "Baby, what's wrong? Are you OK?"

I thought I saw a shadow move out of the corner of my eye as I answered, "Yes, I'm OK, but no, I need help. There's something wrong about this house."

"You aren't making any sense."

"Just listen to me, call the police and tell him my uncle's name. Tell them to come to this house and an ambulance might be needed. Please help me."

"Please help you? Pretty please? With a cherry on top?"

I stared at the phone in my hand as my wife's voice continued to come out of it. It sounded like her but in a mocking tone I've never actually heard from her before.

She said, "Does your tummy hurt? When's the last time you ate? I wonder what Buster tastes like."

I slammed the phone down but whatever it was on the other side was right. My stomach was hurting. I couldn't remember the last time I had eaten. On cue, I heard Buster whining from upstairs.

Only after I started running towards the stairs did I notice just how bruised and sore my legs were from my spill down those steps. I pushed through the pain and climbed the stairs yet again.

Buster was back in front of the bathroom, lying on his side and looking thinner than I had ever seen him. "Losing your mind?" was written all over the hallway now, including on the ceiling and floor. I no longer had any doubt the messages were written in blood, some of them were still dripping.

I walked over and picked up Buster while a banging started at my front door. I would have jumped if Buster hadn't been weighing me down. I heard the front door open and whoever it was identified themselves as the police. I even recognized the voice as belonging to one of the officers who had visited previously. Why can't I remember his name?

After calling out that I was upstairs, I turned with Buster and found the hallway stretched before me, many times its original length. Despite how thin he looked, Buster felt heavier than ever. I knew this was all just some sort of trick to not get me in touch with the police officer.

I thought I must have really been talking to my wife. She had to have come through with calling the police and the ghosts just distorted the end of the call. So I started my trek back to the stairs and shuffled my feet as fast as I could, yelling all the way.

But then a voice answered the police officer. A woman's voice. My wife's voice. I could hear her say, "I'm sorry, my husband wasn't feeling well. He's resting in the bedroom. Can I help you?"

I screamed as loud as I could just to get attention. But it was no use. I heard the officer say, "I'd like to check up on him, all the same."

"Sure, sure, come in. He's right through here."

It was right out of a nightmare. I was sweating profusely while every step seemed to get me nowhere. I tried to speed up but the hallway just stretched further.

And then I heard a man's bloodcurdling scream from downstairs. Suddenly the hallway snapped back and I found myself somehow right at the top of the stairs. 

My momentum couldn't be stopped. I fell down the stairs and landed hard.

On top of Buster.

He howled in pain but at least he was alive. I saw a long thick trail of blood go around the corner and under my closed bedroom door.

There was still a shadow of something under the door. I painfully crept to the kitchen and grabbed my trusty frying pan before making my way back to the bedroom door, as quietly as I could.

My eyes watched the moving shadows nervously. Whatever was waiting there had killed a man. That meant it could kill me. 

But if it could have a physical impact then surely it had to be susceptible to a physical impact too. 

So I raised the frying pan and slowly started to turn the handle. Before I made much progress, the door flew open on its own and something turned suddenly to me.

I swung my frying pan down. The cop stood before me, a smile frozen on his face. We both looked down at the knife plunged into his chest. My hand was still wrapped around the handle.

He fell to the side and I fell backwards to sit heavily on the now clean floor. I was positive I had picked up the frying pan. I could remember it's weight. But now I also remembered going to the kitchen and pulling out the knife.

I seriously wondered if I was losing my mind. I looked down to find I had the knife in my hands again. I dropped it at once and crawled back to check on Buster.

He wasn't moving. I put my head on his flank and was devastated to feel he was still warm but not breathing. I didn't know what to do so I did nothing.

I did nothing for a long time. I was lethargic but somehow made it to the couch in the living room. I waited there until nightfall and then slept on the couch.

When I woke up, I waited some more. I wasn't sure what I was waiting for but nothing horrible was happening to me while I waited. I wasn't in a hurry to change that.

But the bodies of Buster and the cop were still there. I needed to do something. My stomach rumbled as I finally got off the couch. That was another problem with just staying put.

First things first, I found a shovel in an outdoor closet attached to the backyard porch. Digging the hole was exhausting so I settled for just burying Buster now. I planned on getting to the cop after finding something to eat.

I picked up Buster and carried him outside. His fur was still so warm. It was hard to believe he was gone. But there was no life behind his big brown eyes. I gently laid him down in the hole and got to work.

Some time later I wandered into the kitchen and raided the pantry. The house was quiet apart from my efforts. Whenever I stopped moving, the silence was complete.

I wondered if the ghosts had just been trying to make me a murderer after all. Now that their goal had been met, maybe they would leave me alone for awhile.

Just in time because I was starving and didn't need any more distractions. I opened a box of cereal and had a handful up to my lips when I paused.

How could I tell I was actually eating what I was looking at? What if I had actually been opening a box of rat poison?

I still wasn't sure what these ghosts were capable of. I imagined the food turning into worms after it was already in my mouth.

With that thought, I threw the cereal to the ground and stomped off, no longer hungry. I needed to concentrate my efforts on leaving this place.

Right on cue, I walked by the front door.

It was wide open.

Instinctively, I made a leap for it before stopping with my outstretched hand just a foot short of the door. This had to be another trick.

I could see the door slamming shut in my face or even taking a few of my fingers with it. I could feel a breeze enter the house but I was too scared to move.

This was the most impossible situation I had ever been in or even heard of. All of my senses had failed me before. However, my need for freedom eventually caused my feet to move.

Upon slowly exiting the house, I saw the cop car just sitting in my driveway. The door was unlocked and the keys were sitting in the front seat.

My mind went wild trying to explain the situation. Maybe the cop was secretly a murderer and had killed previous owners of this house. Maybe his sacrifice helped them move on.

I couldn't think of any other explanation for my good luck at the time. So I just pushed my misgivings down and got in.

I drove out of the neighborhood without incident but I had new problems. I was in an unfamiliar city, driving a cop car, with no money or other belongings on me, and I had no idea what to do next.

So I kept driving. It felt good to be free of that house. It felt good to see the sun. So I kept driving. On and on.

Left turn.

Right turn.

Left turn.

Right turn.

No idea where I'm going.

And then I realized I hadn't seen any other cars on the road for some time.

Where was everyone?

Where was I?

The sinking feeling happened again, in the pit of my stomach but also around my whole body. I sunk back into the car seat and then realized I was sitting in an armchair.

Back in the living room of my Uncle's house.

My arms were up like I was still holding onto a steering wheel. I started to cry with frustration as I stood up and screamed.

How long had I been sitting there with a stupid grin, moving my arms up and down like a madman?

I turned around and saw my work laptop on the dining room table. It was on and glowing at me. I walked over to it and saw that something was already written down in this post.

It read, "Lost your mind? Good, now you won't mind losing the rest."

Suddenly my fist felt weighed down. I raised it to find another kitchen knife in my hand. I dropped it immediately.

I erased the message and started to type out a request for help. I ignored the screen and just focused on the keys. But I kept hitting them wrong and another message slowly formed.

"I'm sorry. I've disappointed you all. For the Last time, Goodbye."

I could have screamed again but I noticed something had changed. I wasn't in the dining room anymore. I was in the study. I kept writing and writing and writing and my own words started to come out. 

I have sent out emails requesting help, I've posted on the local police department's Facebook for assistance, and I've just tried to keep writing no matter what.

This is my latest attempt to keep my sanity. Whenever I've tried to take a break, I find myself in a new room with new horrors descending on me.

Once I opened the study door out to a hellish landscape and almost stepped out onto lava. I wasn't sure if it was all an illusion but I didn't even want to have a vision of my feet burning so I just closed the door and resumed writing.

I'm not even sure this is all because of ghosts.

I've been doing a lot of thinking lately and the truth is simply that I have no idea what's going on.

As I've gone over these crazy events, I've realized that I can't recall my Uncle's name. Or what he looked like. I'm not sure I ever had an Uncle.

I'm trying to think really hard about how I came here. Did I fly? Drive? I can't remember. Have I always been here?

Even weirder, I can't remember my realtor's name or even what gender they are. I've met them, in person, several times. Why don't I know things I should?

I can't even remember the name of my daughters or my wife. Am I even a father?

Am I even a person? I know I must be because here I am writing in this small study. But now that I think about it, I can't remember who my parents are, what they look like, or anything about my childhood.

Now, I just remember this house and all the nightmares, waking and otherwise, I've experienced here.

I'm feeling a lot like I was back in the cop car. I found a way forward but I really don't know what to do next. This is not a way to live and I'm getting more and more tired.

I'm so hungry.

And I'm finding it harder to focus. I keep hearing voices. And they're getting louder.

I  know if I stop writing. I won't last long. But I'm running out of things to say. My hands are tired. I'm tired. so tire.d

I need to keep writing. But I don't know what to say anymore. What's my name?

I don't know.

Run

Run. And if you can’t run then walk. 
And if you can’t walk, then crawl. But whatever you do, don’t stop. 

It’s only been an hour since everyone on earth, as far as I could tell, heard those same words. I was already walking through the park when I heard them, and after seeing what happens, I won’t be stopping anytime soon. 

It’s been two hours now, I’ve kept walking, I’m tired but stopping is not an option. Some people tried driving, but the act of getting in a car requires stopping, even for the briefest moment. And as those already driving when they heard the rules soon found out, it’s impossible to move indefinitely in a vehicle, especially in a crowded city. Their screams kept me moving. 

It’s been four hours now, and I’m exhausted, with the only thing pushing me forward being the fear of what awaits when I stop. And yes, I mean when, proven by plenty of those around me, eventually I’ll have to stop. Some have just given up, accepting their fate only to immediately regret the decision, some just couldn’t take the screams anymore, and most simply don’t see the point of continuing. And with every step I’m starting to become more like the latter. 

It’s been been about 6 hours, and for the first time i saw what happens up close. I was walking aimlessly down an alley, trying to get away from the madness, when I saw a young man no more then 16 crying. It didn’t even register at first to me until he made eye contact with me... he had stopped moving. His eyes were bloodshot, and not just whites around his pupils, I mean the entirety of his eyes were crimson red. Black tears streamed down his expressionless face, and then he smiled. A wide toothy smile that would’ve screamed of joy if it wasn’t followed by animalistic screams that would give the biggest horror fanatic nightmares. I wish I could say witnessing his dying moments was the most horrific thing to happen to me today, but then it hit me, the realization that I had stopped moving.

Title: Emergency Alert. Do not look outside your windows.

EMERGENCY ALERT.

*Warning, this is not a test, I repeat, this is not a test. Citizens of the world. Lock all doors. Close all of your blinds. Do not go near any windows. Do not look outside. Do not leave your house. Stay in a room with no windows. Gather what supplies you can. Turn all of the lights off, do not open the door for anything.*

When I first heard it, it didn't even sound real. It sounded fake, like something in a horror movie, but it was an emergency so I decided I probably should do what they tell me. I grabbed a flashlight, pillow, my phone, charger, food and basic other stuff to keep me entertained while this stuff happened. I had no idea what was going on, but once I got into my bathroom and got comfy, I texted my parents asking them if they got the alert. They also did. "They said citizens of the world, did they actually broadcast that to world?" I asked myself. So I texted an internet friend that lives across the world, and they said they got it too. Same exact message. And to be honest, it's kinda scary, they tell you what to do, but not what's going on, and people are scared of that.

20 minutes later.

EMERGENCY ALERT.

*This is not a test, I repeat this is not a test. Unknown creatures have been knocking on peoples doors and been killing people that open the door. There is 5 major hotspots. Washington D.C, Tokyo, Toronto, Moscow and London. They have been located all around, but it seems as if they are attacking those first. This is an invasion. Stay in your rooms. Do not open any doors, do not look outside. They can kill you instantly with just a look. May god help us all*

Emergency nuke sirens are going off, tornado sirens are going off. What is going on. Is this a prank? How can an invasion be real? Are aliens real? How can I even comprehend that? I head car alarms going off, I hear things being destroyed. They are here. They are killing. It sounds like a warzone out there but without any guns. What can the government do? Just shoot them? But they would die looking at them. There's no possible way we could ever survive this. We are going to die.

I text my parents but no answer. I text my brother and sister, no answer. I start to panic now. What if my family is gone? And all I can do is listen to other peoples families get murdered. The nuke sirens have started again, and they are very loud. Shaking my whole apartment. I wonder what the other people in my building are thinking. Probably like me, this is it. This is the end of the world. Everyone on this planet will die. I hear a knock on my door. I don't answer it. I hear someone screaming for me to open it. I mean, it sounded human, should I open it? No. That would be stupid.

EMERGENCY ALERT

*This is not a test, I repeat, this is not a test, the extraterrestrial are attacking every major city in the world. There is a lot of them. We have not found out what they want. Stay inside. Millions if not billions are dead. Stay inside.*

It's as if the government have given up now. There's no way to fight and these messages are less helpful each time the come on. If billions are dying then I don't know how we can survive this. I mean, I have so far. But it doesn't sound like for long. I hear buildings being destroyed. I hear cars being destroyed. My building has been hit a few times. I'm hearing my world crumble before me. At this point there's no reason to hope anymore. There's so many dying and there is so much chaos, they will get everyone.

I would love to know what one of these things looks like. But if I see them. I die. I hope someone takes a picture, and if we do survive, I want to see it. I want to see what's killing us. But the end is nowhere near and I don't even know how many people we have left. Should I just kill myself? Maybe I should die before they get me. I don't want to die by those things. Plus, what if I do survive and get survivors guilt? Then there's no way I-

EMERGENCY ALERT

*This is not a test, I repeat, this is not a test. The extraterrestrial have left, and left billions of people dead. If you are alive, please tap the button on your phone now. If on a radio, tune to 104 and state your name and city. We will update you in 20 minutes*

There's no way I would want to live. That's what I was going to say. And yet, somehow, I'm actually alive. Do I want to die now? Well no. But how many people are alive. What did these things want. Why did they attack us? There's too many questions to even ask right now. At this point all we can do is try to figure out some numbers and restart society. How can a world like ours recover from something like this. How long until society is normal again. Will humanity ever me the same? I don't know. What I do know, is that I could off lost everything. I will text my friends and family and come back with some numbers.

EMERGENCY ALERT

*This is not a test. I repeat this is not a test. We have reported a little over 1 billion people accounted for. Not every country has the technology so we will investigate those country's in the coming months. We do not understand what these creatures wanted, nor what they have taken. In the next month or two we will be figuring out the next steps for humanity. May god help us all.*

Only 3 people I know survived. My sister, my uncle and my best friend. Everyone else is dead. I want to kill myself. But at the same time, humanity needs me. We need each other to continue human life. Only time will tell what to do next. If there is anything next.

Edit: It's 2 weeks later. The guilt is too much. I'm a fucking coward. Goodbye.

Title: My son was diagnosed with something far worse than cancer.

“Mommy, my privates hurt.”

Was there any way for me to know how frightening those four words were at the time?

Like any mother would do, I got on my knees. “Let me see,” 

My five-year-old son pulled down his pants and showed me. As I looked, a shock of fear went through me. His testicles were red and swollen.

I tried not to panic and thought about what it could be. Nothing - other than the worst-case scenario - came to mind. The night before, during bath time, his privates looked normal. 

What the hell happened?

Trying my best to not scare my son, quietly, I told him to pull up his pants and put on his shoes. We arrived at the doctor's office 20 minutes later.

After the examination, the doctor sent my son into the waiting room and called me in to have a private conversation.

Private conversation - no pun intended.

“Is it bad?” I asked.

The doctor gave me a look that I had scarcely ever seen. As if what I just asked was the biggest understatement of all time.

“Is it cancer?”

“Please sit down,” he said. “I haven’t seen anything like this during my time as a doctor that's for sure. I’ve already had a colleague of mine on the phone. We’re gonna need an ultrasound.”

Tears welled up in my eyes. “Tell me he’s going to be okay,”

“I can’t say for sure, but I can tell you that if it is some type of cancer, testicular is the easiest to treat.”

He paused.

”You said he’s 5 years old?”

I nodded and said, ”I don't understand how his… You know... he hasn't reached puberty yet, so… this can’t be normal for a boy his age. Can it?”

 ”Before we jump to any conclusions,” the doctor said, ”We need to see the ultrasound.”

Before paying for the visit, the doctor handed me a note with the date and location of the hospital where the ultrasound would be done.

He also advised that I set an ice pack over my son's groin every 2 hours in case the irritation got worse.

First thing the next morning, I drove to the address on the note and met with a man named Dr. Jasper Harris.

“Hello,” He said to me, and then he looked down at my son. He kneeled to his level. “Hello. What's your name?”

My son answered. 

The small talk was making me nervous. All I wanted was to get the procedure done and over with. The faster this would get done the faster my baby would get back to normal.

Dr. Harris led us both into a room and gave my son a hospital gown. 

I sat in the waiting room with a book while my son was scanned. Though I was looking at the pages, I wasn’t reading. My mind was elsewhere; on my son.

Later, Dr. Harris came into the waiting room with a dour look on his face.

“Come with me.” He said.

He brought me into a room full of medical computers.

“Please take a seat,” 

He pulled up a chair next to a large screen. He then showed me the X-Rays.

“Oh my god,” I said and covered my mouth. 

The X-Rays showed two testicles that were larger than any you’d see on a grown man. Both of them came up white on the ultrasound.

“Surgery must be done immediately.” Dr. Harris said, “I’ve never seen anything like this. It seems as if the tumors have encapsulated his testicles.”

I whimpered in the chair. A hand rested on my shoulder to console me. It didn’t help.

“Please,” I said, “Save my son.”

Nothing could be done that day because of complications due to the Coronavirus. I was lucky enough to even have gotten an appointment for the ultrasound that day, so I counted my blessings and stayed patient.

At this point, my son was almost completely in the dark about the whole thing - or so I thought.

We were driving home from the hospital, he was sitting in his booster seat when he asked:

“Mama?”

I looked at his reflection in the mirror. “Yes?”

“When we die, do we go to heaven like grandma says?”

I was speechless. What was I supposed to say? And how did the idea of death get on his mind? Did the doctor say something to him? Was it just a coincidence? Or was there some kind of primal intuitiveness that made him aware of how severe his illness was?

A single tear slipped down my cheek. “I don’t know, baby.”

. . .


He lay there on the operating table, unconscious.

The surgeon and his helpers were shuffling about, preparing for the incision of the cancerous bulbs hanging between my son's legs.

Before my son was put under, he cried and made it clear that he wanted me in the room while the surgery was performed.

“I want you with me,” He’d said.

To me it sounded as if he hadn’t finished the sentence; as if he was trying to say, “I want you with my incase I die.”

I stood in the corner of the cold operation room wearing a medical apron, rubber gloves, face mask, and a pair of goggles. I was looking at my feet, waiting for the inevitable. 

Would he be a freak to his peers?

An outcast to society?

Would he ever find someone to love him? Not as a mother, but as a lover? 

These strange, unwanted thoughts floated in my mind like a rocket on a predetermined trajectory through the star systems of the cosmos.

They told me not to watch if I didn’t want to. I wasn’t, but once I heard the scalpel cut through flesh, there was this sound. A wriggling sound. A sloppy, greasy… writhing sound.

The bodies of the medical professionals surrounded my son so I was unable to see him. I stood on my toes but I still wasn’t tall enough to see.

“Oh my god,” a nurse said.

“What the…” The surgeon said through his covered face.

Wet slapping sounds came. Something was dropping on the room's floor. 

Blood?

The doctor and nurses stood back. One nurse yipped and dropped a stainless steel tool she had been holding. She ran out of the room, the doors swinging behind her.

The sound of wet drips still came. I looked at the surgeon's feet. Something was wiggling on the floor.

Snakes?

No, too small for that.

Centipede? 

No, they didn’t have legs.

As the surgeon and the remaining nurse moved away from the table, I was able to see everything.

Everything.

Cracked open like eggs.

Honey, breakfast is ready.

Coming mom.

Mommy?

Yes?

My privates hurt.

Parasite?

Wet goo and slime from a world far beyond the comprehension of the human imagination spewed out from between my baby's legs. But no… let's not be too melodramatic.

I’ll just say it clearly and simply: My son's testicles had a nest of fucking worms inside of them. 

They writhed and squirmed and moved and slopped over the table; down to the floor, and over the shoes of the surgeon and nurse.

And guess what? Next thing I remember was blackness. I fainted and cracked my head on the tile floor.

I was removed from the room and woke up in a chair located in the large waiting area.  I remember squinting because the chair I was sitting in faced the windows where the sunset was.

Where was I?

Right, the hospital, 3rd floor.

A nurse with scrubs that were a size too small for her came over with a cup of water. 

How did they allow nurses to wear that? Her boobs were practically hanging…

“Ma’am?”

I blinked, and then my eyes focused on the nurse's face. 

“Y—yes?” I said.

“Please drink this,”

“My son,” I bolted straight up, “Where’s my son? Those things. Is he alright—“

Water tipped over the rim of the paper cup as she put a hand on my shoulder to sit me back down.

“He’s fine,” she answered, “There were just a few minor complications.”

Minor complications? Haha, very funny, wiggle wiggle woo. 

“He lost some blood but the procedure is over. You can see him in a few hours.”

I talked to the surgeon about what happened at the operation table. The only answer I got regarding what was inside of my son was: 

“We’re not completely sure what they are or what species of parasitic organisms they belong to. We’ve run some tests to see if he still had any left inside but we're not sure if he’s clean. We’ll have to put him on Mebendazole. It's the best we can do for now.”

And that was it. The men in the black suits showed up to interview me, my son, the surgeon, and both nurses.

Who were they? The fuck would I know?

. . .

It’s been two months since the operation. My son had to stay in a rehabilitation center for about a month and a half, which wasn’t fun for either of us. 

I’m now on anxiety medication. It started the day after I took my son home for the first time in a while. I just lay awake at night worrying about him.

Frequently, like every five minutes, I would get out of bed and go into his room to check on him. 

I wouldn’t get any sleep and I had to spend time away from work.

Things have been hard lately because of it, child support is next to nothing, no thanks to my ex-husband; at least it seems like the medication is working, so now I'm able to sleep.

They sent my son home with a clean bill of health minus two testicles - or so they thought.

I’m sitting in a waiting room once again.

Yesterday, while eating a bowl of cereal and watching the idiot box, my son stepped out of his bedroom and shuffled into the kitchen.

He said four words.

“Mommy, my eyes hurt.”

Don’t Google yourself. Why? Because you may not like what you find…

  One day, I was bored and decided to search for my own name on Google. I have quite a rare name, so I didn’t expect to find many results. Imagine how surprised I was when I came across a website that had my full name in the domain.

  www.(my name).com

  When I clicked the link, it brought me to a message board. I looked at the profile of the website owner and found out that the person was the same age as me and had the same hobbies and interests. There weren’t any posts on the message board, but I was intrigued, so I saved it in my favorites.

  It was about a month later, when I went back to the website. This time, it had more content. There were some diary entries, mostly random things like “The weather was nice today” or “I’m so bored in work”. Things of that nature.

  However, as time went on, I began to notice more and more coincidences. The person lived in the same city as I did. It struck me as rather strange that two people with the exact same rare name would be living in the same city at the same time.

  At one point, I noticed that the contents of the diary were quite similar to my own life.

  One day, I went to a baseball game and when I checked the website that evening, I found that the owner of the site had gone to the same ball game. At first, I didn’t think much of it. After all, tens of thousands of people in the city supported the same baseball team.

  It began to seem like much more than a simple coincidence. Whenever I checked the website, I would notice little biographical details that seemed too close for comfort.

  For example, the owner mentioned their pet dog and the dog’s name was the same as the dog I had when I was a child. The website owner posted a picture of their car. It was the same model of car I had been driving when I was in college. They talked about eating at a certain restaurant. It was the same restaurant I had gone to all the time when I was working at my previous job.

  One day, when I looked at the message board, people had written messages to the owner saying “Happy Birthday!”

  That day, it was my birthday as well.

  I decided to write on the message board for the first time, just out of curiosity. I was going to wish the owner a happy birthday and tell them we had the same name.

  However, when I tried to write something, I realized that there was nowhere to type your message. It wasn’t a message board at all, just a static page.

  “That’s odd”, I thought to myself.

  In other words, whoever owned the website had gone to a lot of trouble to make it seem as if it was an interactive site… as if there were other people posting on it… when in actual fact, all the content must have been created by the owner.

  “Why on earth would someone do that?” I wondered.

  I decided to send an e-mail to the owner.

  It read: “Hi there. Believe it or not, we both share the same name. Nice to meet you!”

  It was just a friendly e-mail.

  The next day, when I tried to look at the website, I discovered that it was gone. It seemed like it had been deleted.

  Then, I opened my mailbox.

  There was one reply. When I looked at it, a chill ran down my spine.

  It just read: “FOUND YOU!”

I was upstairs in my room one night playing video games with the volume really loud when I thought I heard noises coming from downstairs. I muted the TV and listened closer. Nothing. I resumed playing the game for another hour when I heard it again only louder. I was sure I heard it this time and was a little freaked out. To assure myself I went downstairs to the basement where I thought I heard the noise coming from. As soon as I opened the basement door, I was hit with a cold breeze. I went downstairs and saw the window wide open. I was 100% sure I had closed and locked all the windows in the house. I was ready to make a run for it when something stopped me. I turned around and for the first time noticed the closet door was slightly cracked open. I stood for what seemed like 30 minutes in front of that door debating whether I should open it. I moved closer and put my hand on the doorknob. All of a sudden I heard a creepy crackle coming from inside the closet. I have never run faster up a flight of stairs before. I locked the door and called the cops who had an unusually fast response time. They came in and searched the house and not even 5 minutes into their search I heard a gunshot from downstairs. A few minutes later they came out with a deranged looking man probably homeless. They put him in the back of the car and told me they had opened the door and the man was holding a gun shot at them and missed, he luckily missed and the cops disarmed him and arrested him. The scariest part was how close I was to opening that door and likely being murdered.

Title: My Girlfriend Talks in Her Sleep
Author: u/ervanlerpton
Upvotes: 1250
Link: https://reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/mvnjad/my_girlfriend_talks_in_her_sleep/

My girlfriend talks in her sleep. At first it was cute and hilarious to tell her what she said. It was harmless nonsense, “the sky is folding! “ or “we need to raise the ground!”. We’d talk the next day about if she remembered her dream but she never did. I wish I knew what she meant by “we need to raise the ground”. Some context, our nightly routine is for us to start out cuddling and then give up once it gets too hot. Then we’re usually both on our sides, back to back. She would fall asleep before I do and so I would hear the full range of her nightly musings. Honestly at first I was eager to hear what she said, it was always funny to tell her and our friends what she would say while deep in the throes of REM. But now I’m done, I’d prefer she not talk anymore. How am I going to sleep after what happened last night?

Last night around 11pm she was asleep and I was still up reading. Back to back, I hear her mumble something under her breath. I couldn’t quite make out what she said but I lean over from my book to peak at her face and she is sleeping soundly. I return to my book, get absorbed back into its pages. At some point I fall asleep. Next thing I know, I’m woken up by my girlfriend talking at full volume.  I open my eyes, and at some point in the night both of us have turned to lay face to face. My girlfriend’s eyes are wide open, she is staring right at me, mere inches from my face. But her eyes are vacuous, like she is looking through me. These eyes man, its like she was straining to widen them as much as possible. Those are the eyes I fell in love with and right now they are scaring the absolute piss out of me. My heart rate skyrockets and chock-full of adrenaline I throw off the covers and jump out of bed. Looking at her, her eyes follow me like a painting but her body stays still. For one second I decided that my booklight was keeping her awake and what she had said was, “can you please turn that off”. Now out of bed and looking at her, she’s not right. Her body hasn’t moved but her eyes dart from looking at me to looking around the room. I dare to ask her, “ are you alright?”

No response. Those eyes look at me when I speak, though. They are now deadlocked looking right into my eyes. Her breathing hasn’t changed, that is asleep breathing for sure. That’s when, while looking right at me, she says in a too-deep voice, “come back to bed dearie”. My girlfriend has never called me “dearie” before. We have pet names sure, but they range from “pumpkin”, “baby”, to “cupcake”. Dearie sounds like something my grandmother would call me. I decide I’ll get more information before I climb back into bed with a potentially possessed girlfriend. “are you awake sweetie?”. No response. The eyes dart from me to the wall, to the door and then the ceiling. I’m about to nope out of the room when her wide-open eyes rolled to the back of her head. The white from those eyes stands out in the dim radiance of the booklight. No pupils in sight she insists, “of course I’m awake come back to bed?” with a subtle tap of the fingers on the comforter. Looking at her fingers now, I’m starting to come around. She’s never sleepwalked before, surely she is awake now if she is moving her hands? But looking at her fingers it as though she is pretending to have control. They are all going in different directions, one finger pointing straight down and the others to the side? Those hands are not my girlfriends hands, they are simulating normal movement as best they can, though.

I say, “ I’m going to get a drink of water baby, be right back. Can I get you anything?” (fully planning to run out of the house the moment I’m over the threshold). But my normally agreeable and sweet girlfriend decides I’m not allowed to leave, as serious as cancer she says in that too-deep horror voice, “ Take one step out of that door and I will rip out your throat and shit down your neck.”

Shocked but understanding the importance of not letting this beast know I am in trouble I reply, “as interesting as a proposition as that is I think I’m going to …. “ and thinking quickly I grab my water bottle from the night stand. This doesn’t please my girlfriend as she decides to start SCREAMING and fingering her way towards me. It is a supernatural scream, so high pitched and birdlike I feel as though my neighbors 3 houses down were going to ask us if they heard that last night. As fast as I can muster I unscrew the lid and douse her in water. Like I knew what I was doing-  her eyes close, her garbled appendages normalize, and she is back asleep.

I’m going to sleep on the couch for a while, maybe forever. She’ll understand when she’s awake.

I went into a barber shop with no mirrors. This confused me as mirrors are important in barber shops so we can check out the end product of our haircut. When the barber finished cutting my hair he asked me "would you like to check your hair cut?" To which I replied "yes please" 

He then started to strangle me by using a chokehold called the guillotine choke. I then started to feel unconscious and felt like I was floating in the air. I then witnesses seeing myself sitting on the barber chair with me being choked out. I was able to check out my hair cut which was fine. 

I must have been close to death because my spirit was coming out of the body and I could see everything. Then the barber let go of the choke hold and my spirit or soul went back into my body and I turned round to the barber and said "the hair cut looks fine"

Title: My brother didn’t leave his room for three days. My parents wouldn’t let me check on him.

On the third night Jacob didn’t come out of his room, I got the courage to bring it up to Mom. 

“People don’t sleep for this long,” I said. 

She was cooking a casserole, the sixth one this week. We were running out of fridge space for the leftovers, but she kept making more. I would watch her from the corner of the kitchen, her posture curved and her newly greyed hair hanging over the food. I walked over and tugged at her sleeve, but she didn’t respond. She was slathering butter on the top crust. 

“Mom,” I said. “Did you hear me?”

“He needs his strength,” she said. “We can’t be bothering him.”

Before I could say anything, Dad walked in. His eyes were red and swollen, but he was smiling. He had three cans of Coke in his hands. 

“I’m starving,” he said. “I still have the taste of that horrible cafeteria food in my mouth.”

“You would think hospitals had good food for how much money they make,” Mom said. 

“I know, right?” Dad said. He placed the Cokes on the counter. 

Mom didn’t want us to go near Jacob’s room, but I was getting worried. I peered out from the kitchen. His room hung at the end of the hallway like an abandoned lighthouse, the only sign of life being the *NY Yankees* poster taped to his door. Near the ground, there was a small sliver of space to see if he had turned on his lights. It was still dark, as it had been for the last three days. 

I turned back to Mom.

“Shouldn’t we check on him?” I asked. 

“I don’t know why places like Wendys or Burger King don’t put up little shops in hospital,” Dad went on. “I mean, you have hundreds of people who are stuck there for days on end. That’s consistent business.”

“It’s all politics,” Mom said. “They sign these big contracts that are impossible to break.”

“Right, right. That makes sense. Right.”

Dad was standing next to Mom now, his face inches from the casserole. He took a long sniff.

“Ahhhhhhh,” he said. “Smells great.”

“Do you want some of the leftovers while this finishes in the oven?” she asked. “I think we still have some from yesterday. Wasn’t the spinach and ricotta one good?”

“Very good. Very, very good,” he said. “I couldn’t stop eating it.”

“Jacob’s gonna’ devour these when he gets the appetite,” Mom said. 

I turned back and took a step into the hallway. The distance between me and his room felt long and narrow, like a high wire. When I got away from the casserole smell, I hit a different smell. It reminded me of old gym socks. Even with Mom’s array of candles and incents, I still smelled it. It cut through everything. 

The last time I saw Jacob was on the drive home from his treatment. His face was a pale green and his eyes kept rolling back. Mom said I had to keep talking to him, to keep his focus. I told him about my friends from school and how they keep pranking the teacher by putting tacks on her chair. It wasn’t true (I saw it on a TV show once), but I was running out of material. It didn’t matter though. Jacob didn’t even respond. All he did was cough. Pink drool was spilling onto his t-shirt.

“Danny,” Mom said. “Why don’t you heat up some of those leftovers. We’re all craving that spinach and ricotta casserole.”

“I can’t stop thinking about it,” Dad said. “I was dreaming about it last night.”

I ignored them. I kept my focus on my brother’s door. I didn’t dream about the casserole like Dad; I kept having a different dream. My brother was running into my room and flicking my ear. It was a game we used to play. We would tip toe up to the other’s door then wait for our moment. Then, the attacker ran in and got one or two good flicks before retreating. 

In my dream though, Jacob would run in and flick me, but I wouldn’t move. I just stood there. He would flick, and laugh, then flick some more. Sometimes, he would flick so hard my ear flew off.  

“Earth to Danny,” Dad said, snapping his fingers in my face. He was standing in front of me, blocking my view of Jacob’s door. “Do you mind heating up four portions of the casserole in case Jacob wants some? We’re going to eat that *before* this next casserole because we want to make sure Jacob’s able to try it because, in my opinion, it was definitely one of your Mom’s best.”

I looked up at him and held my eye contact. I couldn’t say what I was thinking, so I wanted Dad to feel it. Maybe, if I stared long enough, my feelings would translate.

But, Dad looked at me for only a moment, then away. In that brief connection though, I saw something I didn’t want to see. It was like staring down the tunnel of the world’s deepest well. 

“Come on now,” he said. He grabbed my shoulders and turned me around. His voice got heavier. “You’re going to want to heat up each piece individually because if you do them all at once then you won’t get even heat through the pieces and you’ll probably have a couple that are too hot and others that are too cold and then Jacob won’t get the full picture of how good these casseroles are.”

Dad let go of my shoulders and walked ahead of me, but I stayed in the hallway a moment longer. I turned to look at my brother’s door one last time. I fantasized about walking up to it and going inside. But, I was afraid Mom would yell at me. 

Besides, I never liked going in there. He had a puke bucket next to his bed which always had pink splatters in it, and there were always clumps of hair on his pillows. Back before the last hospital visit, Mom would make me go in there and talk to him, but I always made up some excuse, like I had a cold and didn’t want to get him sick. When I couldn’t get out of it, I would stay in there for a few minutes and watch him try to breathe. I would tell him about some TV episode I saw, then run back to my room. 

I looked up. I thought I was walking back to the kitchen, but I was moving toward the door. I didn’t want to, but I kept moving, like my limbs were controlled by a puppeteer. I put my hand on the doorknob. I turned. The gym sock smell filled my head like helium. 

Through the darkness, I could make out a sliver of my brother’s face. The soft evening light fell on him. His eyes were open, staring at the ceiling. His arms were straight as rulers and his fingers curled like a blooming rose. 

I walked to side of his bed. Red spit fell off his lips. He looked like a frowning clown. 

I flicked his ear. 

It was hard. 

I walked out and closed the door behind me. As I walked back, I seemed to forget what the inside of his room looked like. With the door closed, it could be anything. Jacob could be doing jumping jacks, or reading comic books, or plotting his next ear flick attack. 

When I walked into the kitchen, I heated up four plates of spinach and ricotta casserole. When they were done, I wrapped Jacob’s plate in aluminum foil and put it in the oven to keep warm. Then, Mom, Dad, and I sat in the dining room and ate in silence.

Title: "Daddy's Never Gonna Hurt You Again"

I was my dad's only child. Being a daughter, you'd assume a father would be protective. I'd get beat regularly, and much worse. When you're six, you'll do what you have to in order to survive, because running away is not an option. I suppose I knew it was coming. It was Friday night, and once night had fallen and it was only my mother and I, the dreaded routine of beatings and grasping at the straws of futility would only be a matter of time.

“Go, Lily. Go sit in the closet and wait for me". My mother was a Cuban immigrant with nothing but courage flowing through her veins. Still, I never understood at the time what a restraining order was, nor why it could so easily be broken. When the rumbling engine rang out and potent exhaust fumes began to flow through the vents, I could only recoil, because evasion was my only defense.

Predicting the the level of his rage depended on the force of the car door slamming, so when it audibly shattered the driver's side window, I knew it was worse than ever. As a child, my anxiety would render me unable to move.  A spider flash-lit. I couldn't make split decisions. So when the door is kicked down and I hear “HELENA! HELENA, YOU BITCH! THAT DOOR BETTER BE UNLOCKED!”, I likely was staying put, even if running was the best choice.

By this point I'd dissociated from my body by focusing on two ants on the floor carrying piles of potato chip crumbs when the thud of my mother's body hit the kitchen floor. I could unwittingly escape the horrors inevitable to come by staring at a spot on the wall, and imagining myself watching from the other side of the room to cope until it ended, every single time. As for mother, this night, no words were uttered. She never got a chance.

“Lily, baby…daddy's home! Come out and daddy won't be mad!!!!”. Muscles tensed agonizingly tight, I was frozen once again. Tears streaming down my cheeks, I'd learned to cry silently. The stumbling, uneven footsteps on the first floor told me he was more inebriated than usual, and also it told me that mom was really hurt. Usually she'd fight him with every fiber of her being on his way to the staircase, despite it always resulting in bloodshed.

And then, one….two….three… the footsteps creaked up the steps. ”Lily, here I come! Better be special for me tonight! Be a good girl and come out!”. Mom always instructed me to hide in different places, but never thought to tell me to just leave. The internal force of my inability to react and the external evil of my impending death had me feeling acceptance. At only six years old, I was already prepared to die, and die horribly. 

Four….five….almost up the steps. I'm a spider under a flashlight, wanting so terribly to make the decision to run to the bathroom and hide behind the curtain, but too frightened to act on it. “Mommy, if ghosts exist, then please do something!”. Then, that inevitable cracking of the broken top step. He's here. Dad was at the top of the steps. “The bathroom. The shower curtain. Hide in plain sight! Do it, Lily! It's your only chance! The first place he'll look is the closet!!!”

I was screaming inside. Then I heard the bathroom door slowly creak opened, steps moving inside, and the shower curtain…metal against metal, he'd ripped it off the hinges. “No Lily THERE! WHERE COULD SHE BE? Where did mommy hide you this time???”. Sweating, heart racing, fingers running up and down the delicate skin of my belly, and brush over the soft skin of my arms, overtop of the already — existing scars. How much worse will it get? How much more blood would I lose once again?

Dad was just outside the bedroom, and then the footsteps halted, right outside the door. By the sound of the metal against the hollow door, I knew tonight he had a bat. Broke my legs with it once. I began to grip and pull at my clothes, and then, I couldn't stop it. I began crying profusely, and in an effort to hopefully live, even if it meant disfigurement, I stood up, and got ready to step out into the shadow of the six foot tall, brooding figure bearing down on me. Ready to take the whipping, beating, or worse, that thing which would awaken me in sweat from my nightly terrors.

“If baby girl's in the closet, come out, come out wherever YOU ARE!”. I'd accepted my fate. And then a dull, loud “tack" noise, and vibration of the floor from a loud slam. Dad was so drunk, he'd fallen over. Maybe now I could run, but I couldn't get my legs to move. And then, the visual of my mom's bloody corpse flashed in my mind, and miraculously, something imperceptible caused me to jump up and run. I pushed out of the closet and ran to the door, prepared to jump over dad's hopefully unconscious body and leave out the back door…

…and as I approached the door, I was stopped in my tracks. Standing in the hallway was my mother, unharmed and untouched. And at her feet, dad's lifeless body with an axe in his back. I gazed up at my mother with watery eyes in wonder and astonishment, and when her eyes met mine, she said the sweetest thing to ever fall upon my ears…

….”momma found a good hiding spot, baby. Daddy's never gonna hurt you again".

Title: I found a tape of a woman being killed.

I was at my grandmother's house, helping my grandmother move furniture around. She became my mother figure after the death of my mother when I was a young child. And I had been staying with her ever since my car accident. My grandmother helped nurse me back into health. So I made an effort to alleviate her of any and all physical tasks, I felt it was the least I could do.

 It was in the attic, when I accidentally knocked over a box. The box was filled with VHS tapes, with the farthest dating back to 1990. All that was written on them was the year. There was a tv in the attic as well because we used the attic as more like a functioning room than a storage space. So I decided to play the oldest tape. I expected to see happy memories, home videos, scenery, anything other than this.

The video starts—with whoever is holding the camera—filming a woman sitting alone at a small table at a coffee shop. She's reading. The camera was zoomed in on her hair glowing in the light. Fixed. The tape then skips to a new setting, in what looks like downtown Chicago somewhere. I can see the back of the same woman from before, walking down the street, oblivious to the person trailing and filming behind her. The sky is now a dark gray, I can see lights from passing cars glinting off her shiny boots. The camera is clambering and rubbing up against the jacket of the cameraman. He or she's not far from her, but is far enough away to show that he or she's not with her. Clearly stalking her.

The scene lasted maybe 5 minutes of the monotonous walking until it shifted to the woman now bound and stowed in the trunk of a car. She was taped up, unable to speak. All I could hear was the sound of heavy rainfall accompanied by her screaming and crying. Her muffled panic broke my heart in two. My spine became frozen, I couldn't open my eyes any wider. Any moment the film could shift to something so much more grotesque, so morbid, so life changing, and I could do nothing but watch in horror.

I saw a black-gloved covered hand sprout from behind the camera slam the trunk door closed, trapping her inside. It's now clearly night.

The next scene skips to the woman, now beaten and bloody while tied to a chair. The location looks to be a warehouse somewhere. The only light coming from a single fluorescent bulb above the woman, illuminating pools of crimson red blood at her feet. The camera is steadily held, so much that it seems to be propped up by a stand. I can hear the poor woman moaning in pain underneath the tape covering her mouth. I can also hear something shifting around on the concrete, like someone adjusting their stance. It seemed manic. I could hear clambering of metal, like tools being packed... or unpacked from a bag. My stomach now fully turned. The stalker then walks into frame, showing only his back. His head was completely covered in a balaclava. He carried a blade in his right hand. My heart completely halted, the stalker held her drooping head up, tilted her face upward, and began to slice her throat from her left ear all the way to the right. She squirmed and gargled in her desperate and useless attempt to survive. I had never seen so much blood in my life. The killer then takes off his mask and stares into the camera, flashing a toothy grin. The film then abruptly stops. 

I was held in place by my now shot nerves. My blood slowed into stillness, completely discoloring my body into an almost corpse-like white. My grandmother was watching me. She, shakingly, tried to console me from across the room. Struggling to form words through the river of tears streaming down her face. She said she didn't want me to ever be reminded of who I *was* before my accident.

Title: My son's teacher has been giving him some strange homework
Author: u/Pudenator

I have recently had to move to another city, due to work. My family and I, which consists of me, my wife and my nine-year-old son, Dylan, were suddenly uprooted from our quiet life and had to move to a busier city, which none of us were used to. My wife had to find another job in the city and my son had to leave friends behind and start at a new school, which I hoped would all be worth it for the sizeable pay rise that I was receiving. 

We have been moved in to our new house for about a month now and everyone seems to be adjusting to the new lifestyle that we now have. My wife has found a new job, which she enjoys, and she has made a number of new friends there. My son has also settled in well to the new school. He is in the third grade and, due to being in a busier city, is in a larger class then he is used to. I don’t think he minds though; he has already made a few friends that have helped him adjust to the new school. His teacher, Mrs. Wagner, was a younger woman, around thirty, who Dylan seemed to really like. He would always come home and tell me and my wife all about the fun he had at school and the fun lessons that Mrs. Wagner would teach. I had only met her the once, when I dropped Dylan off at school on the first day and as far as I could tell, she was a very nice lady.

Every night, Dylan would come home with different homework that he would have to complete before school the next day. I’m not a massive fan of homework but it seemed like the homework that Mrs. Wagner always set was quite simple tasks that could easily be completed in a night. One night, Dylan had to ask a parent find out what their parents did for work and ask three questions about their job, and another night he had to research their favourite animal and find out three interesting things about it. It was always simple tasks like that, or it was simple work sheets that Dylan could complete in half an hour or so. 

Every night, I would ask Dylan what his homework was for that night and then I would help him with it if he needed help. That’s when I noticed the homework becoming a little bit strange. One night, in Dylan’s third week of being in the new class, he came home, looking upset. I asked him, when he entered the kitchen, what was wrong, and he told me that everything was okay. I then asked him what his homework was for that night and he told me that he didn’t have any for that night. This was surprising because he had some sort of homework task every single night he had been in Mrs. Wagner’s class, so it was strange that he suddenly didn’t. Dylan then left the kitchen and went into his room, shutting the door behind himself. He didn’t usually close the door, but I thought that he must have wanted some privacy. I could tell, though, that something was wrong, but he didn’t want to tell me. 

Dylan spent most of the night in his room, apart from dinner time, when me and my wife told him he had to sit at the dinner table with us. He seemed to be in a better mood during dinner and was fairly talkative and making jokes, like he normally did. After dinner though, he went back to his room and closed the door. We decided to let him stay in there for a while but after an hour or two, I went in to see him and let him know that it was time to go to bed. I walked down to his room, opened the door and when I looked inside, I saw that he had already fallen asleep over his workbook. I quietly walked over to him to gently wake him up and move him to his bed, but that’s when I saw it. The homework task that was set for that night. The title that was written in Dylan’s work book was ‘*Would I miss my parents if I no longer lived with them?’.* 

At first I was taken a back; this was a very weird task to set for a group of nine and ten year-olds. I didn’t really know how to react to this. I continued to read, though, to see what else he had written. He had written:

*I would miss both my Mum and Dad very much. I love them both a lot and they help me with everything. I love spending dinner time with them. But I would probably love someone else as much as them if I had to, like you were saying today, Mrs. Wagner.* 

When I read the final sentence, I felt chills down my spine. “*I would probably love someone else as much as them if I had to”.* The words struck me like a brick to the face. What had Mrs. Wagner been telling my son? What was the purpose of telling him these things? I decided, probably stupidly, not to tell my wife about what I had found. She would worry, and she probably had a right to worry, but I didn’t want to concern her. I decided that I would instead confront Mrs. Wagner tomorrow and ask her about this strange homework task.

The next day, I took Dylan school like I normally do, except this time I got out and walked up to the classroom with him. I saw Mrs. Wagner, alone in the classroom, as I entered the room and she greeted me with a smile.

*“Hey, how are you?”* she said as I entered the classroom, “*How is Dylan settling in?”.*

I answered that he was settling in well, but I did have one or two concerns. She asked what they were and so I explained.

*“I was just curious about the homework you set yesterday? The one about how much they would miss their parents? I am just concerned because it is a very strange and confronting thing to ask a group of third graders. I also noticed that Dylan wrote that he might have to love someone else if he had to, like you told him. I would really like you to explain that.”* I asked her, quite bluntly.

*“Oh that”,* she replied as she let out a slight laugh, “*Yesterday, I was teaching about how parents love and protect their kids, but also how that there are also other people that would be there to help them if they need it”.* 

I wasn’t satisfied with this answer and was about to question her further, when suddenly a large group of school children entered the classroom. They were all walking in two rows. They all greeted Mrs. Wagner and greeted her one by one. They seemed very well behaved, almost too well behaved. I then saw Dylan take a seat next to one of the students, who was staring to the front of the classroom with their arms crossed. At the entrance of the rest of the class, Dylan’s behaviour seemed to change. He seemed to sit up a bit straighter and his eyes widened as he begun staring at the rest of the class. I looked around and noticed that all of the students were staring at the same spot. All their eyes were pointed at Mrs. Wagner. Something didn’t feel right, but I knew that Dylan needed to stay at school, and this was probably some sort of morning routine they had. 

I left, still with concerns about the homework but I decided to wait and see if any other strange homework would be set, before I would take this matter further. I decided that I would pick Dylan up from school, though, and so I left work a little bit early and drove over to the school. The school bell rang and soon all of the students were dismissed and starting to come out of the school gate. Most of the kids came running and screaming out of the gate, apart from Mrs Wagner’s class. They all walked out in a line, walking in time. This disturbed me. I had never seen a group of students so well behaved, especially even after the school bell had rung. Dylan walked over to the car and hopped in. He didn’t say anything and sat in his seat, staring straight forward. 

I asked him if he was okay, and he just replied with the word ‘*Yes’.* I drove him home, in silence, and when we got home and inside, Dylan went straight to his room and closed the door. I knew something was definitely wrong, but I didn’t know what. I decided to leave him alone until my wife got home and I would tell her everything that had been going on. She got home about half and hour later and I sat her down and explained everything that had being going on. She sat and listened and started to look more and more worried with every word I said. 

*“Maybe I should go and talk to him, he might like that”* she said once I had finished explaining everything. I agreed and so she went into his room and I waited out in the lounge room for them to finish talking to each other. Fifteen minutes later, Dylan walked out of his room and into he lounge room. He was holding a small work book and he said, 

“*Can you help me with my homework, Dad?”.* 

*“Of course, come and show me what you need help with?”*, I replied.

He held out the notebook and I took it out of his hands and read the homework task for tonight. Written on the top line of the page was one task. 

*Research the best way to inject your parents with Anaesthetic.*

I barely finished reading the sentence when I felt the sharp pain in my neck, and I looked down and saw the needle sticking out of the side of my neck. Dylan was holding the other end of the needle, a blank stare on his face. Everything started to go black and the last thing I remember seeing is Dylan staring down at me, as I lay on the floor. 

I don’t know how long I was out, but I was awoken by my wife screaming and crying. I woke up, startled, as she continued to scream.

*“He’s gone! Dylan’s gone!”,* she kept screaming. 

I looked up at her and the first thing I saw was the small pin prick that was on the side of her neck. She had been injected too. I didn’t know what to do, but I knew I had to find my son. I tried my best to get up, but I think the drug hadn’t properly worn off yet because I still couldn’t move properly. I could move my arms, so I managed to get my phone out of my pocked and dial the police. I explained to them what had happened, and they said that they would send officers out and would begin looking for Dylan. I then noticed that it was already 9 in the morning and so I decided to ring the school and see if Dylan had gone there. I dialled and a lady answered the phone. I asked if she had seen Dylan from Mrs. Wagner’s class. 

*“No, I am very sorry, but we haven’t seen him today. In fact, we haven’t seen anyone from Mrs. Wagner’s class today, they are all absent. Which is very odd because Mrs. Wagner hasn’t shown up for work either today”,* the lady on the phone said.

I hung up and sat in silence for a moment, my wife had heard what the lady said, so she also just sat there in total silence.

That was all three weeks ago and Dylan is still missing, along with Mrs. Wagner and the rest of his class mates. All the parents of the kids in Dylan’s class have the same story; they were injected with something by their own children and when they woke up, their child was gone. No one knows where they went, but we all had the same questions. Were they all together? Was Mrs. Wagner with them? Was this all planned? Why were all the students acting so strange in the day leading up to this? Were they hypnotised or drugged? Or maybe something even more sinister was happening?

I am 35 M and have a wonderful wife who is 32 F. We have been married for 7 years and have 3 beautiful children that gave me shivers of excitement down my spine when they were born. My wife (Marianne) has suddenly been starting to wear a red ribbon around her wrist ever since our last date night (July 18 2023), I wonder sometimes why she wore it. The day I found out why she did was the day I almost hung myself out of confusion. “Honey your back from work!” She said with a slight grin on her face whilst tightening the ribbon around her wrist. “Hi babe, the office was a bit crowded today so my boss let me come home early”, as I replied a disgusting stench drafted into my nostrils. I immediately gagged wonder what the hell the smell was and noticed it came from the direction in which my wife sat. “Babe what is that smell?” I say pinching my nose in disgust, “Oh nothing!” she said a few moments later. I looked at the red ribbon and noticed it was a bit stained. So without warning I just pulled it off, beneath the ribbon was the most vile thing I have ever witnessed in my entire life. There underneath the ribbon was bits of torn flesh, rotting as maggots swarmed her hand, I instantly shrieked and ran out of the room barfing in the bathroom. I am currently writing this post as she is banging on the bathroom door begging me to open it up. What should I do?

Title: I found out my boyfriend was drugging me every night.

Last month, I noticed that something is off with my boyfriend. He was being too nice recently like cleaning up his dirty dishes and being attentive to my needs. I would have thought this was a good thing if only I haven’t caught him waking up in the middle of the night and leaving the house. I tried waiting for him to come back but I fell asleep after some time and the next thing I knew, he was back in bed with me.

That morning, it clicked on me like I found all the pieces to the puzzle. That’s why he was acting so nice. And recently, I would admit that we haven’t had some sex and I thought he just wasn’t in the mood. Now, I know why. He was having an affair.

I was furious and heartbroken. I told my best friend, Natalie, all about it and she was as heartbroken as me. She kept asking if I was sure about it. I mean, what other explanation it could be? He’ll be gone the whole night and he’ll be back in the morning, what did he do? Buy some milk??

I said to her that I have a plan. I’m gonna wake up before he does and catch him red-handed. My best friend just nodded and said that was a good idea. That night, my boyfriend prepared a nice meal for me, something he hadn’t before, and I was mildly surprised. I pretended not to know anything about his infidelity so our conversation went normally.

However, when we finally settled back in bed, I had fallen asleep almost instantaneously. My sleep was so good that I wasn’t able to wake up at midnight. I was disappointed with myself. How could I have slept on it? What’s weird was in the following nights, that kept happening to me. I couldn’t wake up in the middle of the night. I also tried staying up all night but at some point, I would fall asleep. That is very unusual since I have been a night shift employee before and I didn’t have this kind of trouble of suddenly falling asleep. Sometimes, I couldn’t even remember what happened last night.

My crazy brain thought maybe my bf was drugging me. Putting something to make me sleep through the night. That’s the only possible explanation I could think of. But then, I asked myself, how did he know about my plan? My heart sank as I realized the answer to my question. Natalie, my best friend. I couldn’t believe it. Why would she betray me? Is she my bf’s lover???

At this point, I was intoxicated with anger. I skipped dinner and only drank water from tap. I made sure none of my bf’s drugs would reach me. My boyfriend was even persistent that I should eat or at least drink some milk. To me, that was a confirmation that he was indeed drugging me. I was about to confront him about his infidelity right then and there but I felt a blunt force hit me at the back of my head and I was out.

When I came to, I was tied up in bed and my bf was watching me at the corner of our bedroom. He was biting his lips and was pale as a sheet.

“What is this?” I asked him.

His eyes lit up when he saw me awake. He then run to our living room and called for someone. My heart sank as I saw who it was. It was Natalie! I yelled immediately after seeing her.

“It was you! How fucking dare you!” I shouted at her.

Natalie asked me to calm down. “It’s not what you think,” she kept repeating.

“I’m gonna kill you both when I get out of here!” I kept trying to free myself but to no avail. They used some of the thickest rope I’ve seen.

“Babe, listen to me,” my boyfriend said. “I’m not cheating on you. And certainly, Natalie and I have no romantic relationship. I get out of bed every night because I need to stay safe.”

“Stay safe?” I asked. “Stay safe from what??”

“From you” he answered quickly.

“What?”

“Jace, it’s near 3. We should get out of here,” Natalie whispered.

My boyfriend then took out a paint bucket and painted my hands and legs with red paint. I squirmed and yelled as he did it in a hurry. All the while, I was thinking who is this person? Is this really my boyfriend? How could he do all of this to me?

As if he could hear my thoughts, he kissed my forehead and said “You’ll understand everything tomorrow, I promise,”

Before I could reply, he and Natalie ran away and I was all alone in our bedroom.  I kept screaming for help but I knew it was pointless. My mind was racing as fast as my heartbeat. My lungs felt like it was shrinking as I breathe for air. No. No. No. How could they do this to me? Why are they doing this? I kept trying to free myself but I got exhausted at some point and lost consciousness.

When I woke up, I was still in bed. But I noticed that the ropes that bound me last night were now roughly severed and my wrist burn like hell. As I looked around the room, I understood Jace. The floor, the walls, and the ceiling as well, were full of red handprints. [My handprints](https://www.toodat.com/community/Ifoundoutm/WhostheSuspect/3GWpmbkR8EazJn4K).

2:49 am I lie awake in bed laying on my right side, my wife is behind me, she's awake I can tell, I can feel her staring at me from behind. Shes always been a night owl but tonight feels different, she feels wrong. Shes breathing heavy, I should check on her, but for the life of me I cannot bring myself to turn around. 
3:03 am I can feel her moving closer to me, she moves ever so slightly and I can feel her touch the back of my hair, is she caressing me? The hairs on my neck are standing up, why is her hand so cold? I can see the door to my room through the darkness, my entire body just wants to jump up and run to it! I can't do that, I'm being silly.
3:13 am she's right behind me, I can smell her breath, its horrible, I've never smelled her like this before. I can feel something pressing into my back, is it a knife? It doesn't feel sharp, I gotta do something! 
I decide to jump up and turn the light on but right before I do the hall light turns on, I can hear my wife coming up the stairs, shes on the phone with her mom; I can hear her crying. Apparently her grandpa died earlier today, he never liked me, maybe thats why he decided to pay me a visit tonight.....

Officer Miller sighed heavily. The dead bodies in front of him must have been Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson, although with the decay, it could have been anyone. Neighbors had called police about a terrible stench coming from the apartment. He was no detective but it looked like the young son who was still missing may have been involved and it broke his heart. He knew this family and while the Stevenson’s could be tough on their son, they loved him. The officer went for his radio to call it in when he felt a blow to the back of his head. His vision started to go dark as he heard

Title: The results from my DNA Genealogy test shattered everything I thought I knew about my life.
Author: u/R-M-Staniforth

My family, the Antonov’s, always boasted proud Russian heritage.  My grandparents on both sides of my family migrated from The USSR when they were children.  My Father always told me the stories of his grandfather, Maksim Antonov, who migrated to the United States with his family, only $6.55 in his pocket.  However, we knew very little past Maksim

With all of these new DNA Geneology tests now readily available, I thought it would be fun to surprise my parents by getting a better picture as to our ancestry.  I secretly purchased a test kit and sent in my sample. 

Some 6 weeks later, my heart jumped when I saw the notification that my results were ready to view.  I eagerly opened the chart, hoping this would bring insight and clarity for my family.

When I opened the results, however, I found only confusion.  There wasn’t any Russian listed at all.  I showed 62% Scottish, 11% Welsh, 10% German, 8% Italian, 5% Arabic, and 4% Indigenous American.I figured if there was one person who might be able to explain this one, it would be my father.  

My father was rarely a person to be quick to anger, but when I showed him the results he lost his damn mind.  He yelled at me worse than any other time in recent memory, shouting expletives about fraudulence and incompetence.  He demanded that I delete the results and never speak of it again.

I had never felt so let down, but alas I deleted it and tried to forget.  That only lasted for two days, however, as this morning I received the call that would change everything. 

“Is this Max Antonov?”  Asked the caller.

“Umm, yeah, who’s this?”  I replied, with uncertainty.  

“This is detective Reynolds.  I need to have a word with you, privately.”

I was concerned, but my parents weren’t home so I hopped on my bike and pedaled to the station.  The officers were very kind, too kind, I could tell something was off.

“We need to talk to you about your DNA test,” said detective Reynolds, “Your profile matches a murder victim in a cold case.  I really don’t know how to explain this to you, but that victim could be your mother.”  

“That’s not possible,” I assured him, “my mother is alive and well.”  

“Max, the Victim was found murdered and her 3-week old baby was missing and never found. The crime happened on January 6th, 2003, which is the date you listed as your birthday.  Look, I know this is a lot, but we’d like to take your fingerprints so we can compare them to the finger prints on the birth certificate of the missing baby.”  

All I could do was nod.  

Hours passed as I waited for results.  They said they were rushing, but it felt like days.  Finally, Reynolds came into the room.  He put his hand on my shoulder and gave me a pitiful look. 

“Son, I’m sorry to say it’s a match.”

Title: They Say It Takes 2 Days for Your Cat to Start Eating Your Body
Author: u/BrenWillPohn

They say it takes two days before your cats will eat your body if you die. Well, I can tell you that it's longer than that, but not by much. 

I have five cats. Yes, five. My fiance and I started with one, then graduated to three after a friend started having allergic reactions and had to give his two up. Then, the same happened a few years later with one of her friends. Now we're at five. It's too many cats in my opinion, but what can I do at this point? They're here to stay and I love them, unconditionally. 

A while ago now, my fiance left for a trip to Thailand. She's into Muay Thai and so is her brother, so he invited her to go with him on a training trip his gym was taking. This left me home alone for a while which, as an introvert as well as a professional writer who was currently in the midst of his second novel, was not unwelcome. I was looking forward to some valuable alone time and a distraction free environment in which to make some progress on my writing. 

Three days into her trip, I had been doing just that. Around 4pm, I finished my third chapter in as many days. I was thrilled, but needed a change of pace as my mind was beginning to give off sparks. One of the lights in the high ceiling of our living room had gone out, so I figured I'd take this time to replace it. I went into the garage and got the ladder, then set it up under the light. 

I stood on the second from top step looking up. Even though I'm tall, I could still barely reach the light. I went up to the next rung knowing full well it wasn't safe. I could reach it now but it was still at an awkward distance. I thought about it for a second then decided to just go for it. I didn't want to have to find another ladder or call an electrician, plus I'm pretty sure footed, so I stepped up onto the top of the ladder. I could comfortably reach the light now. 

The bulb was a pretty standard screw in type that could easily be changed out, except that there was a thin metal rim that went about halfway around the circumference of the fixture and blocked the bulb from coming out. Try as I might, I could not figure out how to get the bulb around it or get it off. I finally resorted to brute force and gave it a good yank. Nothing happened. I yanked it harder. Still nothing. I gave it one more firm pull and it came off! Unfortunately, so did my feet from the ladder. 

I came to lying on my back, staring up at the broken fixture. I couldn't move. I could tell I was breathing and a dull aching in my back that seemed many miles away told me that I still had some life in my nerves. But otherwise, nothing. 

Panic didn't last long as there wasn't anything I could do. Since I was conscious and could feel a bit, I figured it would pass. I resolved myself to wait it out and began focusing on my breathing, not only as a meditative practice, but to help regain control of myself too. 

As time passed I could sense faint nudges around my feet, hands and head. Now and then a shock of fur would pass before my eyes. Once, my breathing became more difficult and far off somewhere I could feel four little paws on my chest. They were hungry, but there was nothing I could do. They'd have to wait it out just like me. 

Darkness fell and then the light returned. My situation hadn't improved. More and more I felt the little nudges or the poke of a paw on my face. I kept focusing on my breathing. If I was making progress with it, I couldn't tell but, for the time being, it was keeping me sane. 

Again night fell and again dawn broke with no improvement. The nudges and pokes were getting more frequent and far more desperate. I could feel a gnawing sensation in my own stomach and my lips were beginning to feel dry and cracked. 

Sometime during the third night is when I felt the teeth. Again, that far away sensation, almost as if it were happening to someone else. Even so, the feeling was unmistakable. Like two steel rods sinking into the flesh of my calf. Then a tug. Then a rip. I tried with all my might to make myself scream. Nothing. I felt the teeth again. Another pull. Another rip. A wet chewing sound. I waited for my lungs to fill with air and then focused all my energy into forcing it out. A low, strained groan escaped my lips. But it was enough. The teeth stopped and I felt the faint vibrations of little footsteps going away. 

I woke up later in the night to what felt like a small piece of sandpaper rubbing against my leg. Someone was licking up the blood around the wound. Again, I groaned. The licking stopped for a moment and then began once more. I tried to kick out with my leg and managed a small twitch. I heard paws run off again. 

It was starting to feel like a small fire was smoldering in my leg. Just embers for now,  but it wasn't good. How long had they been at it while I was asleep? How much longer could I hold them off? What was left of my leg? How much longer could I last like this? 

This same cycle continued for days. First, the feel of teeth in the flesh of my leg, arm or, sometimes, my face. Next, a twitch or a groan to shake them off. Sometimes more than one set of teeth at a time. Sometimes, they wouldn't leave. I could feel the wetness of blood on parts of me. I could feel the small embers of pain and infection all over. My stomach felt like it was filled with nails. My mouth was like hot sand. I was growing weak. 

With what was now left of my sanity I tried to count the days I'd been lying there. She must have been close to returning home. It must have been long enough that someone knows something's wrong. I had to be close to the end. It was hard to tell though. With the sensation of five little sets of teeth all tearing at five different parts of me, concentration was in short supply. 

I wanted to shake them off but I was so tired. All I wanted was to rest. I forgot about my breathing. My eyes began to go black. My thoughts began to fade… Far off somewhere, I heard the rumble of a car engine. I heard the jagged metal grinding of a key in a lock. I heard hinges creak. I heard footsteps. I heard screaming.

Title: I booked a cabin in the mountains. The previous guests left a strange entry in the guestbook
Author: u/OlGooGoo

I moved to Seattle from Kansas about five years ago. I’m one of those “tech bros” all you locals are always complaining have ruined your city. Well, I guess it’s my city now. Sorry ‘bout ya.

One of my favorite things about the Pacific Northwest is the mountains. I try to get away from the city as often as I can. So when I found this cabin on the Skykomish River, I decided I would treat myself to a mid-week getaway in the early fall.

I arrived this morning. The cabin was very cozy, tucked away among the trees next to the river banks. There was a hot tub on the back deck and wifi for us tech bros who only like the façade of “roughin’ it.” I put my bags on the bed and decided I’d explore inside before I explored out.

There was an extensive DVD collection, but mostly romantic comedies and family movies. Magazines from five years ago littered the coffee tables. In a little nook in the bedroom, I found a basket containing a few notebooks and local travel guides. The notebooks were, according to the labels, for “Guest Notes.” I smirked and laid down with the most recent one. I’d probably get a kick out of this.

It was mostly what I expected--people talking about their kids and their dogs and how much they loved the hot tub and the river. Pretty boring. I flipped through the book until I got to the most recent entries. It looked like the last guests had written a few pages[.](https://www.instagram.com/olgoogoo/)

*“10-10-2020 10:00pm - The noises started around 8:30 tonight. At first we thought it was just the rain. We never should have read that book we found in the woods.”*

My eyes widened and I looked more closely at the page. This was a little bit more interesting than the white bread entries before.

*“Well...maybe ‘read’ is the wrong word. There wasn’t enough in any language we understood to actually read. It was nothing but weird symbols and grotesque drawings, except on the very last page, which read in English:*

*When darkness overtakes the day*

*That’s when Ol’ GooGoo likes to play*

*Teeth so sharp, eyes so red*

*Once you see him, you’re good as dead.*

*Okay, pretty weird, but whatever. These noises, though. We thought it was dripping rain, but it isn’t the right cadence. It sounds more like licking, and every so often there is a crunching sound. Maybe it’s just our imaginations. We aren’t used to the forest, after all. It’s so dark and quiet, so every sight or sound seems magnified. As I was closing the curtains in the bedroom, it looked like...something...was standing at the riverbank. Something vaguely human, but with large horns and big wings folded behind it. My husband says it was a tree. When I looked back, it was gone.*

*Time for bed now. I hope I can sleep. The noises haven’t stopped.”*

I chuckled. Clearly someone was getting into the Halloween spirit and having some fun with it. Still, I looked up and through the window in the bedroom at the raging river beyond, and I felt a little uneasy. The sun was starting to set, and the big picture windows did give the impression that someone--or something--could be watching from the woods. I got up and closed the curtains before continuing reading, just to ease my mind.

*“10-11-2020 7:45am - The bed in this cabin is wonderfully comfortable. My husband slept like a rock. I, however, kept dreaming about a horned creature standing at the corner of the bedroom, staring at me. My husband said it was just a dream, but when I got up this morning, all of the curtains were opened. My husband says he didn’t touch them and I must have left them open last night, but I know I didn’t. At least the noises have stopped. We plan to enjoy the hot tub and relax today.*

*10-11-2020 2:10pm - We spent the last hour in the hot tub. Very nice, but I kept seeing something darting among the trees. Even back inside, I feel like I’m being watched. My husband thinks I’m going crazy. Maybe I am.”*

Yeah, I think you probably are. Maybe drink some beer and chill out. This page had started out with the same neat, tight writing of the entry before, but as the page went on, the writing became larger and more erratic, slanting across the page. The last entry on the page was the most haphazard-looking.

*“10-11-2020 8:00pm - The noises are back but now there’s chanting too. My husband says it’s the neighbors but it isn’t a language we know. I see glowing red lights in the woods. I’m afraid to close my eyes. My husband says I’m overreacting. I don’t think I can trust him anymore…”*

Chanting? Now I was really sure this was a joke. However, I strained my own ears in the quiet of the cabin and listened. The sun had definitely gone down now, but it was still raining. I could hear the dripping outside. Maybe if you were losing your mind, it did sound a little bit like licking.

I admit that I gasped when I turned the page, even if it was all a joke. The next pages were barely legible, scribbles and symbols and nonsense. I will try to write it the best way I can for you.

*“10-12-2020 8:00am - I’m supposed to go home this morning. I can’t believe I stayed in the wods all by myself all weekend. åll of this ålone time måde me å little pårånoid. I’m påcking the book I found. It is still wet for some reåson, like it hås been in the råin åll weekend.*

*On second thought I don’t think I will leåve. I wånt to ståy here forever. I wånt to become one with ǾL GǾǾGǾǾ \~\~\~\~”*

The bottom third of that page was just odd symbols that I had never seen before. The next, and final page, was simply “GOOGOO” written over and over again, covering the entire page.

I rolled my eyes and closed the guestbook. Very funny, people. I got up and tossed it back into the basket with the other books, then rifled through them to see if there was anything good that I missed. Maybe something better than this fake monster story.

Behind the travel guides was a small, leather book that I hadn’t noticed before. Curious, I picked it up. It was strangely wet, like it had been in the råin åll weekend.

Title: Bloodbather
Author: u/psyopticnerve
Upvotes: 691
Link: https://reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/jfdi05/bloodbather/

Once a year, my parents had me take a blood bath. It was always on the day before my birthday, a tradition I didn’t enjoy, but never questioned. My mother would lead me to the tub, my father sitting on the edge, dipping his fingers in to check the temperature for me. I would sit while they washed it into my skin and hair, making sure that I was completely covered before letting me get out. Then I would have to wait as it dried, making my skin feel tight and sticky. I was then sent off to bed with a hug and kiss. On my birthday, the first thing I did was shower off, watching the red retreat down the drain. Then it was like any other birthday. Singing, presents and cake. It never crossed my mind that our tradition was abnormal.

I was excited for my tenth birthday, the prospect of having two digits to my age was exhilarating to me. I’d been homeschooled my whole life, but had plenty of friends in my neighborhood to invite to my party. I was asking my friend, Jimmy, if he was going to be able to come when I caught a glimpse behind the veil.

“Ah, man! I have to go visit my cousins on Saturday! But maybe I can play with you the day before?” he had asked. I thought about it, but knew that my annual bath was due that day. Disappointed, I explained to him why that wouldn’t work.

“Shucks, that’s the day I have to take my bath,” I told him.

“Okay, well maybe after that?”

“No, I’ll be all sticky. Plus all the blood gets on everything,” I could tell by his expression that I had said something wrong. He went running his mouth to everyone, calling me a vampire and upsetting both of our parents, albeit for different reasons.

That night, I had the first discussion about the blood baths with my father. He sat me on the couch and got real serious.

“Now, Ben. Today will be the last time you ever talk about the baths you have to take,” he stated sternly. He went on to explain that not everything we did was considered normal, and that by keeping it to myself, I was doing us all a favor. After that discussion I became more curious. It was intriguing to me that not everybody had to take these baths.

As I aged into a teen, I started doing what all boys do. I rebelled, and hard. Since I didn’t go to school, I tried even harder to fit in when I was around my friends. I smoked, I vandalized, I stole alcohol from my parents. Some of it could be attributed to peer pressure, but a lot of it was my own choices. I wanted a reputation, wanted to be revered as some sort of anarchist. So I kept pushing boundaries, creating a large wedge between my parents and myself.

The eve of my sixteenth birthday I decided that I would refuse my blood bath. I was lying on my bed, listening to music and reading, when my mother came in to tell me they had gotten it ready for me. I knew it was coming, had my response ready.

“I’m not taking it,” I said, refusing to look up from my book.

“Ben, please don’t make this difficult. You know you need to,” she said, wringing her hands fretfully. I continued to ignore her as she pleaded. After a while my father came down to see what the delay was.

“What’s going on?” he asked, appearing in the doorway. My mother told him the situation, his face turning bright red.

“Ben, this is happening one way or another!” he shouted. I threw my book across the room.

“Oh, you think so?!” I fired back, instantly bristling to the challenge. His eyes widened and his nostrils flared out, he was more angry than I had ever seen him.

“That’s right,” his voice now becoming a growl. Without a second thought I charged at him, knocking him aside and running down the stairs. I could hear him screaming at me all the way past the driveway, begging me to return. I ran for a long time, finally running out of breath and resting near a city bus stop. I sat down for a few minutes, aware of a strange sensation at the ends of my fingers. They felt tingly for a bit, then they started to feel hot. Terrified, I watched as they began to blister, running up past my knuckles and cracking open the skin on their way upward.

Howling in agony and shocked by what I was seeing, I fell to the ground and writhed. There wasn’t a soul around, my cries for help went unanswered as the skin kept on bubbling and cracking, making it all the way up to my elbows.

Headlights appeared in front of my eyes. Though I was nearly blind with pain, I recognized my father’s car. He leapt out, grabbing me under my armpits and pulling me into the vehicle. I kept screaming during the drive, showing him my disintegrating arms. We drove at a breakneck pace, my father cursing the whole time. His face white, he told me to hold on a little longer, that I would be okay soon.

I expected him to take me to a hospital. When we pulled into our driveway my entire arms and shoulders looked like raw hamburger meat, the skin blistering around my neck and down my sides. It was the most intense agony I had ever been in. My body went into shock. I vaguely recall being carried out of the vehicle, my mother running out to help. We went up the stairs, both of them grunting under my weight. Then blackness took over.

Voices around me, swirling distortedly, started to come back into focus. Gradually, the sensation of pain seemed to lighten. My arms were no longer on fire.

“He was this close, this fucking close!” my father was saying, sounding like he was going to break into sobs. My mother hushed him, telling him he had done a great job, that he had saved me again. I could now feel that I was in a familiar substance. Warm, inviting, soothing to my blistered skin. The blood bath. When they noticed I was awake they both broke down, telling me how worried they had been, how they could never live without me, that I was their entire world. Their hysterics got me going as well, realizing how awful I had been to them over the last year. They both held onto my hands as I let the blood saturate and heal my mangled skin.

The next year I had learned my lesson. My father prepped the tub for me, giving me a half smile as I thanked him after he told me it was ready. I never asked why I had to take them, I never asked where the blood came from. It just seemed like something that we all knew was better off left alone.

Which brings me to this year. My father, who is now in his sixties, sat me down again.

“Ben, its time you understand some things.”

He went on to explain that, late in my mother’s pregnancy with me, she started having complications. She was on bedrest for a while, barely able to move. She delivered me two weeks before her due date, slightly underweight, but very sickly. He explained that he could do little for me but watch as doctors and nurses did their best to keep me alive throughout the next months.

“I felt helpless. I begged to trade places with you and take the suffering you were going through from you,” he told me, reaching forward and taking my hands.

“There was this man, I had seen him at the hospital often. He saw what we were going through, our family. And he offered me something. Told me he knew a way to help keep you alive. I didn’t want to hear it. I told him to leave me alone, but he persisted. Claimed he was an angel of sorts. As you got sicker and sicker, closer to Death’s door, he kept telling me he could help.”

I shook my head, this was a lot to take in, all new information to me. My father continued, tears spilling from his eyes as he went on.

“Ben, I was desperate. I loved you so much, I couldn’t lose you. I gave in, asked him to help. I begged, told him whatever he had to do, to do it. He smiled at me, told me he would save you. And just like that, you started to get better. I was shocked, the doctors even more so. We went home, you were healthy. It was a miracle.”

He wiped his eyes, leaned backward, trying to gather his thoughts, then looked at me.

“It was just before your first birthday when I saw the man again. It seemed like he had come out of thin air. He said the only way for you to stay alive was to… give you your baths each year. I didn’t believe him at first, but then we saw what was happening to you, to your skin. It was just like what happened when you were turning sixteen, only then it was much slower,” he spoke shakily.

“So I… I did what I had to do… I... spilled the blood. I filled the tub. And I have done it each year since. I’m sorry son, I wish things had gone differently,” he finished.

I leaned forward and embraced him, having no words for the situation. We stayed like that for a while. Eventually he broke it off, facing me again.

“Ben, there’s something else… You know that I’m getting older. The time will come, maybe sooner than we think, that I won’t be… around anymore,” he bit his lip, holding in his emotion.

“Ben… when that happens… you’ll have to… start filling the tub up yourself.”

My child died after only a month on this earth. I’m going to spare myself the tears on explaining how, but the tears of my wife are ones I’ll never forget.

Grief is ugly, it’s so fucking ugly. When we lost him, it sounded as if my wife was regurgitating fragments of her soul. Her wails could’ve shattered glass, curdled blood. The cries would turn to screams; screams at the universe, at whichever sick, twisted higher power would let this happen, at herself, at me. She’d scream until the skin of her throat shredded to ribbons.

I’ll be honest, I didn’t cry. I don’t remember if I even shed a tear. But not because I wasn’t upset, I didn’t cry because it felt like she was already doing it for me. No pain is more shared than a grieving mothers cry.

I wished there was a handbook on grief, a For Dummies, if you will. One that could’ve especially prepared me for the before and the after. Before, you’re just waiting, like you’re watching an hourglass of life on its last grain.

My heart is pumping while he flatlines, and it hits like a wave. I’m going to have to grieve, I thought to myself. Before I could even experience it, I thought about how it was coming right for me. And I knew that in the blink of an eye, life was going to be something that I’d have to fight for.
Maybe I was already grieving him before he went, maybe I was prepared. Or I just thought I was, I don’t think you ever could be prepared. 

Then, you reach the after. Not the moment you leave the hospital room, or even the drive home. It’s the moment you open that front door, the air sucked out of the room, and you feel that thorough fucking void; that void in your chest, in your relationship, in your home. This is it, this is my life now. This is real.

What hurt even more was that this new life wasn’t so foreign to me, it was one I had nearly a month ago. I felt so guilty for not grieving him but instead grieving for what he could’ve been. I grieved for the first birthday and dozens after it, the first steps, the graduations, I’d even trade a hormonal teen fight with him over this. 

I couldn’t help but grieve the life he could’ve had instead of the one we lost. My wife felt differently; she missed their skin touching, humming to him, even dragging herself out of bed at 3am because he was crying again. 

We never really discussed it, but we could just tell that we were grieving down two separate paths. Our backs were always turned in bed, she’d flinch when I’d touch her; it was as if she was allergic to me, but I understood she needed her space.

The funeral was absolute Hell on earth. Actually, I think rotting in the fiery pits of Hell would feel better than attending an infant's funeral. At least it’d be warm, unlike the icy grip of mourning. I remember walking up to the casket alone, staring down at him. And all I could think was,

“Caskets shouldn’t be that small.”

He laid in a box that was small enough to cradle in my arms. When they lowered him into the ground, the cries emerged again. My wife wailed into the clear morning sky, so guttural it was as if it was happening all over again. But she didn’t collapse into my arms, she collapsed to the ground, as if she wanted to join him.

Then you open the front door again and the voids are even deeper, everything is even realer. We packed up our child’s nursery, and his future, into boxes, then fought about whether or not to throw it all out. She said she wanted them in the attic, I said I’d never be able to go up there again if we did.

So we just left it all in that room, collecting dust. The door stayed shut at all times, but never locked. Just closed. I think it symbolized our grief, in a way; we closed the door on that part of our lives but weren’t ready to lock it away forever.

Each day doesn’t get easier, it just gets farther away from the day it happened. The mornings are the worst; you wake up, your eyes creak open, the morning sun is pouring through your window, and then you remember that you’re grieving, as if you could forget.

Little things began to tick us off. One of us would forget to do the dishes and it’d end up with someone sleeping on the couch or taking a long, midnight drive. We tried couples therapy but we needed so much more therapy than that. It wasn’t even about us, it was about him. The wedge was him.

I was at my wits end with how to deal with this, but it appeared that my wife was one step ahead of me when I heard a soft humming from our bedroom after I came home from work. My brows furrowed as I made my way upstairs; the last time I heard her hum this tune was at the hospital, right before the heart rate monitor hummed back.

When I pushed the cracked open door, I felt like I was dreaming. She was laying in our bed, cradling a baby in her arms, looking down at it like she could see every planet, every star, every galaxy. I remember pinching my thigh as I stared at her, the slight pain stinging.

She was so engrossed by it, I could’ve stood there till the end of time and she wouldn’t have noticed.

“H-Honey… ?”

She finally looked up.

“Oh, hi.”

She stretched a smile that had become so foreign.

“Uh- What… do you- What are you holding?”

“Oh- This? It’s a reborn doll.”

I raised a brow at her.

“They’re realistic dolls for… mothers to-… to help me… cope!” She nodded rapidly, her smile weakening.

It was as if I had disrupted the fantasy just by asking.

“Oh…”

I couldn’t help but stare at it, and stare at her because of the way she’d stare at it, as if she was holding her own flesh and blood and not plastic.

“Has it… helped?”

“I’ve only had it for a few hours now, but it’s… comforting.”

It rubbed me the wrong way at first, but if nothing else was working, I was glad if this would.

“Do you wanna hold him?”

Suddenly, I felt myself at a crossroads. I didn’t know if I could hold a doll and give her the reaction she wanted, I can’t look at it like it’s my son. But I knew that this wasn’t just about me, so I hesitantly walked over and stretched my arms out. 

A slight chill ran down my spine as it’s cold skin was placed onto my palms. I pulled it close and cradled it, staring down at it. And suddenly, I crumbled into tears. It felt too fucking real. I dropped to my knees as it laid in my shaking arms, my scrunched face already wet.

I knew it wasn’t actually my son, but I realized how much I missed this, not just the moments we lost. My wife patiently waited as I wailed with my head hung. I let out cries I never knew I could, my voice cracking with each ugly sob. After that day, I noticed things getting better. It didn’t fill the voids, but something else stood inside of them for a while, just to keep them dormant.

Whenever she had one of those days where standing on her own two feet didn’t feel worth it, she’d hold it, hum to it, sometimes she’d pretend to breastfeed it. I will admit it still creeped me out to some extent; it was comforting in a way, but I knew it wasn’t him. And I think this is when the wedge grew deeper.

One day I came home, and as I walked upstairs, my entire body locked as I saw light leaking out of a door. That door. I knew it was unlocked, but I never expected either of us to ever open it, at least not so soon. I swallowed roughly as I approached it. Slowly opening the door revealed empty boxes and a full nursery; she had set up everything again. 

I observed the room as I stepped in, a feeling of concern weighing on me. Then, I noticed something in the crib. I wrapped my fingers around the railing and leaned in, my brows furrowing as I saw the doll laying.

“I didn’t hear you come in.”

My body jolted as I whipped around.

“Jesus! S-Sorry, you… What is this?”

“What?”

“What… is this?”

“Uh, our nursery?”

“Well, yeah. But why is everything unboxed?”

“Our baby needs a nursery.”

We stared at each other with accusations of insanity.

“I- Look… I’ve researched these… dolls, and I understand how this helps you. I’ll admit, it’s helped me a bit too. But this? You know this isn’t our-“

“This isn’t our what?”

Suddenly I was tongue tied.

“… I’m just concerned.”

“I unpacked all of this myself, I’ll put it all back when I want to. Ok?” She said slowly and sternly, daggers shooting from her eyes.

I could feel a million words crawling up my throat, but the only thing that came out was,

“Ok.”

“I think I need some alone time with him.”

I nodded, looking away as I slipped past her. I was trying to be patient with her, I really was. But I just couldn’t meet her at the lengths she was going. Pretending this is our kid may help her, but it only made me feel worse. 

That night, not a word was exchanged under those sheets. I was turned towards the window, and she was turned towards the baby monitor that she put new batteries in. After making faces out of the moon, I eventually fell asleep.

Suddenly, in the middle of the night, I felt myself drift away from my dream and wake up. My eyes slowly creaked open, the dim moonlight coming through the window. The room was silent, except for the cries that came through the baby monitor.

I sat up and rubbed my eyes, staring at the monitor as staticky cries emitted from the speaker.

“Liv… ? W-Wake up…”

I shook my wife till she groaned out of her slumber. She lifted her sleeping mask and looked at the monitor. My eyes darted towards her, then back at the monitor. She sighed, tossed her mask onto the dresser and stood up.

“I’ll handle him, get some sleep.”

I stared at her wide-eyed, my throat knotted, as she tiredly walked out of the room. As she stepped into the nursery, I began to hear her over the speaker.

“Shhh, shhh… it’s ok.”

I blinked like a deer in headlights as I listened to her hum, the crying slowing to a stop. My eyes shifted towards the door as she walked back in, grabbed her sleeping mask and laid back down. She didn’t say a word as I just continued to stare.

A part of me wanted to go into the nursery, but I just laid there till my eyes dried and ran bloodshot. Before I knew it, the sun was up and I had to go to work. I slowly stood up and stiffly got ready. I tried to convince myself that it was a dream, but I had already woken up from one.

When I finished getting dressed, I kissed her as she slept and left the room. As I passed the nursery, I paused for a moment. At first I considered going in, but instead I pressed my ear against the door. But there was nothing, just absolute silence. I don’t know what I thought I was going to hear, I didn’t even know what I heard last night. I couldn’t tell if hearing something now would’ve made me feel more or less insane.

That day at work was grueling. I kept falling asleep at my desk, had a hard time processing what people were even saying to me; it was just one big blur. When I got home, the first thing I wanted to ask my wife was what the fuck happened last night, but after the incident in the nursery, I feared she’d tell me that the doll crying is normal because it’s our son.

When I got home, I was ready to fall flat on my face. My wife stood at the sink washing dishes, her head turning as I walked in.

“Hey, hun.”

“Hi…”

“How was work?”

“Uh… y’know, the usual.”

“Be quiet when you go upstairs, I just put him down and it wasn’t without a fight,” she chuckled.

“… I’ll be sure not to wake it- him.”

I anxiously cleared my throat as she quickly glared at me, then looked away. At least I was trying to play along. I quietly walked upstairs, minimizing the creaks of each step. As I passed the door, I could feel my breathing and heartbeat halt to a stop; something about it just always knocked the wind out of me.

Dinner was so silent, you could hear a pin falling before it even dropped. Chewing and sipping filled the dense quiet.

“I was thinking of taking him to a Mommy and Me class.”

I looked up, my chewing slowed.

“Is that-… Sounds good,” I bit my tongue and smiled.

I couldn’t tell if she was being serious or if she just wanted to talk.

“I also wish you’d spend more time with him. You avoid the nursery like the plague,” she laughed weakly.

“I’ll, um…I’ll make sure to do that.”

“… Thank you.”

Watching her eat, the look on her face, I could tell she could barely get the food down her throat. She was trying, she was really fucking trying. I felt guilty for not being more understanding, it was hard to accept that we were just going to be grieving in different ways no matter what. But I was at a crossroads when it felt like our grief couldn’t help each other. 

But the one thing that was itching at the back of my mind was last night. It was crying, how could it be crying? It didn’t seem to surprise her either. I tried to make any logical reasoning for it; maybe she set an alarm with a baby crying sound? Or if there’s a speaker inside of it? Something to make it feel realer? It was possible, except for one other thing: it sounded so much like him.

If you’re not a parent, a baby crying is just a baby crying, but I could pick out those cries from a crowd. Maybe it’s just grief playing mind games, I couldn’t tell. Later that night, after brushing my teeth, I was walking to our bedroom when I noticed my wife in the nursery. She was slowly rocking back and forth in the rocking chair, humming to it.

“Hey. I finally got him to sleep,” she said after noticing me hovering in the doorway.

“That’s good…”

“Come say goodnight.”

I stared for a moment before forcing myself to enter the room. She stood up and walked over to the crib, then gently placed it down. She leaned down, kissed his forehead, then turned to me. I glanced at her, then at it. I could tell she was expecting me to do the same. I hesitantly leaned towards it, my lips puckered. 

Suddenly, as I got closer, a pungent smell entered my nostrils. I tried to ignore it, but I recoiled as I got closer, the foul stench growing stronger. My wife glared at me in horror as I gagged, clasping my hand to my mouth.

“What the fuck is wrong with you?!”

“I-I’m sorry, it-“

“HIM. NOT IT, HIM!”

“Ok… HE smells like a fucking dumpster fire! What? Does he have built-in fecal mechanics too?!”

Tears welled in her eyes as I looked away with guilt, my entire body shaking.

“Just admit that this is a joke to you. You think I’m embarrassing myself, that I’m crazy. Just say it…”

“Liv- No…”

“Actually, don’t… Just sleep somewhere else tonight; the couch, the fuckin’ sidewalk, I don’t care.”

“… Ok.”

I flew out of the room before I could burst into tears of fury. I felt like such a fucking monster. Prioritizing both of our healing was just tearing me apart, it was tearing us apart. I curled up on the couch and screamed into the pillow, leaving tear stains on the cover. I sobbed until it exhausted me, eventually knocking me out.

All of a sudden, I was ripped from my slumber at the sound of glass shattering, my body jolting awake. I quickly sat up, my eyes darting around in a blur. Throwing the blanket off of me, I stood up and searched for the source of the sound. The room was pitch black as I ran my hand along the walls to find a lightswitch.

Suddenly, my eyes shot open as something sharp impaled the bottom of my foot.

“Fuck! Shit!” I hissed to myself as I lifted my foot.

Now I was hopping around till I found a lightswitch, while also avoiding glass that I could not see. Eventually, I found one and illuminated the kitchen. I looked down at my foot, a small train of blood drops behind me. I lifted it up, blood leaking down my skin. It was a small shard of porcelain. So I pursed my lips, took a deep breath, bit my cheek and yanked it out.

I swallowed a scream as I placed the crimson coated shard on the kitchen counter. Then, I noticed some white powder on the bottom of my foot as well. I limped around the kitchen, soon finding a shattered cookie jar and an open flour bag spilled across the floor.

“God fucking dammit…”

I quickly tied an unused dish rag around my foot and began picking up the shards. The stress of the cut and the mess overshadowed the thought of how it even fell in the first place. But this thought came front and center when I noticed small flour coated footprints leading out of the kitchen.

I slowly placed the last shard in the trash as my eyes stared under furrowed brows. I limped over and kneeled down, observing them closely. They looked like… No, impossible. I told myself it was impossible. But who else could have feet that small? It wasn’t my wife, and it wasn’t an animal. An uneasiness clouded over me as I quickly vacuumed it up. 

The trail was longer than I realized as I exited the kitchen and made my way through the living room. Eventually, I reached the stairs, noticing the footprints went up them too. My eyes slowly glided up, then stared deeply into the dark hallway. I was able to at least try and logically explain the crying the other night, but I couldn’t make anything of this.

I took a deep breath and slowly made my way upstairs. With each footprint that vanished into the vacuum added one more beat to my pounding heart. When I reached the top step, I realized the trail led even farther. I continued to follow it, taking the curve it took that ended at a door. That door.

I slowly stood up, my heavy, shaking breaths hitting the wood. But I couldn’t bring myself to go in. I just wanted to cry, feeling like I was being haunted by my own grief. I could’ve been standing there for a minute or an hour, either way it felt like forever before I finally stepped away and entered the bathroom.

I held back tears as I made sure there wasn’t any glass left in my foot, then properly bandaged it. With everything that had happened and was happening, all I could think was: why us? Why me? I just wanted to be a husband, a father, a family. Why does life's unfairness have to be so cruel? It’s more than just not getting what you want, it’s losing what you love. It’s your son dying after only a month of being. It’s not unfair, it’s just cruel. So fucking cruel.

After securing the bandage, I limped out of the bathroom, my body weighing with exhaustion. Then, I halted in front of the nursery door, my eyes scrunching shut as the sound of crying suddenly came from behind it. Never in my life have I prayed, not even for my son, it felt like shouting into a void. But at that moment, I prayed. I prayed for it to end. I needed it to end. But nobody was listening, life wasn’t that fair, I should’ve known that.

I opened my eyes, tears welling in them, and kept walking past it. The cries grew fainter as there was a ceiling between us, but I could still hear them. I could feel them crying for Daddy as I laid my heavy head on the couch pillow. I had hoped that my wife would wake up and deal with it, but she never did. 

The entire night I laid there, the tears drying against my cheeks as it relentlessly cried. My psyche was shattering piece by piece as it grew impossible to even keep a grasp on reality or try and figure out what the fuck was going on while its screams filled my ears and bounced around in my skull.

At that point, I just wanted to die. Or to at least just be numb. To have the ability to not give a single fuck about anything happening, even if just for five seconds, would’ve helped me sleep that night. By the time it was morning, the crying had stopped at some point, but I don’t remember when. 

“Jack,” my wife suddenly said, her hand resting on my shoulder.

I jolted, my head whipping towards her.

“Didn’t mean to scare you.”

“It’s fine, I just… didn’t sleep.”

I could see guilt hanging on her expression.

“Is everything alright… ?”

“I want to… apologize for last night. You’ve been very patient with me, and I feel like I’ve been asking you for more than you can handle.”

We paused in silence for a moment, our eyes shifting around each other.

“I… appreciate it. I’m sorry, too. I’ve been too judgmental. We don’t have to be on the same page to care about each other.”

She sat down next to me and rested her head on my shoulder. I kissed the top of her head and enjoyed the quiet with her. I wanted to bring up what I saw last night, but figured now wasn’t the right time.

“And about the smell… You weren’t wrong. I went to go see him this morning, and it hit me like a truck,” she chuckled weakly. “Turns out… he was molding on the inside, which can happen,
apparently. I reached out to the seller and she said that it happens due to… poor upkeep.”

Suddenly, she broke into tears, collapsing into my chest. I held her close as her tears soaked through my shirt.

“How did I manage to lose him twice… ?”

My heart shattered.

“It’s ok… It’s ok… You can always get a new one.”

“No, I can’t!”

I looked into her eyes with deep concern.

“Olivia… Can we speak honestly for a moment? With no hard feelings?”

She slowly nodded.

“It’s a doll. You can get a new one.”

Even then, I pushed the wrong buttons as she ripped herself from my arms and stormed upstairs.

“You don’t get it. You never did.”

“Y’know what?! No! That’s not fucking fair!”

“None of this is fucking fair!”

Before I could get another word in, she was already in our bedroom, the door slamming behind her. I buried my face in my hands as I drew deep, slow breaths. Everyone always said grief brings people together, but all this is doing is tearing everything apart; my marriage, myself, my understanding of what’s real and what isn’t.

I spent another work day in a complete daze; I even got reprimanded by my boss for “lack of work ethic.” When I got home, I was met with a distraught wife. She was definitely still mad at me, so I considered whether or not to even ask if she was ok.

“Hey, hun. Are you alright?”

“… I threw him out.”

“Oh… I’m so sorry.”

“Are you?”

“Liv…”

“Surprised you didn’t say ‘thank god’…”

“Look, I- I’m sorry about this morning. But I’m trying, and I know you know that. But it’s hard when you keep flying off the handle! Do you… want to see somebody? A grief counselor?”

“He was my grief counselor. That’s why I’m getting another one, just like you said. Right?”

“… Right. Whatever works for you.” I smiled weakly.

She sipped her coffee with a daze in her eye, like she could see something that wasn’t there. Just by looking at her you could tell she was dangling at the edge. But I couldn’t pry and prod anymore, for her sake and mine.

She let me sleep in our bed that night, but we didn’t exchange any more words than “goodnight.” I could feel the back of her ankles against my legs, at some point she even turned towards me in her sleep, but she didn’t wanna touch me. She needed just enough space, and I let her have it.

A night without it in the house gave me the best sleep I had gotten since he died. I woke up feeling refreshed for once, but I quickly noticed the emptiness next to me; she must’ve gotten up early. As I left the bedroom, my brows furrowed as I heard humming from behind the nursery door. 

My puzzled expression twisted further as I saw my wife cradling it in her arms.

“Good morning. I… thought you had to get rid of him?”

“Good morning. And I did, this is the new one,” she smiled.

“Wow? Already? So… fast.”

“Express shipping,” she shrugged with a chuckle.

“Sweet…”

“I’m gonna try and put him down for his nap. Could you brew me a cup?”

“Yeah, sure,” I smiled before closing the door behind me.

The second she couldn’t see me anymore, I stood absolutely baffled. Something about it just seemed… off. How could she have gotten a new one that quickly? It didn’t add up. She had gotten so attached to it, the thought of her wanting to keep it, no matter the mold, didn’t surprise me. What hurt the most is that she’d lie to me.

After filling the steaming mugs, I set them down at the table and read the news on my phone as I waited for her to come down.

“He didn’t put up a fight, thank god,” she sighed with relief as she trotted downstairs.

“That’s good,” I sipped my coffee, keeping my eyes on the screen.

She sat across from me, taking slow sips as she stared off in a daze again. I occasionally glanced up at her, watching her tap her finger against the mug and bite her cheek.

“… Are you alright?”

She laughed at the question, circling her finger around the rim of the mug.

“Weather’s nice today,” she responded.

“It is… Maybe you should spend some time outside. You could take him out for a walk.”

“Yeah… That sounds nice,” her words trailed off like she was dreaming.

I helped her take out the baby carriage that we never got to use and watched with unease as she laid the doll in it.

“Hope you two have a nice time,” I smiled.

“We’ll be back soon.”

We quickly kissed before she was out the door. And finally, I could breathe. It was only a mere few hours, but it was still time to breathe. It was also time to think. The past few nights, I had experienced things that were beyond what I thought grief would be like. I knew it’d be haunting, but not like this.

I never really believed in the supernatural, I’d say I’m a skeptical person. But after the constant crying, the footprints… I couldn’t make any logic out of it. I’d run in circles to death before it made any actual sense. And my wife seems to know more than she’s letting on but I was scared that one more question would push her out the door. I couldn’t lose her, too.

But now our grief wasn’t just going down two different paths, it was going in completely opposite directions. She needed the doll to heal, and I needed it gone to heal. But I didn’t know how to get rid of it without hurting her in the process. I thought about tossing it and making her believe she misplaced it, but that just felt cruel. I didn’t need to put her under any more distress.

By the time she got back, I hadn’t really moved off of square one. I still understood nothing, I figured out nothing, I was just aching even more.

“Are you feeling better?”

“Yeah, it was nice to get some sun. This little guy enjoyed it, too! Didn’t you, didn’t you!” She gushed.

I couldn’t help but feel so uncomfortable watching her treat it like it was our son, but it’s her way of coping and I had to respect that. To at least put myself at some ease, I told myself that I’m just under a lot of stress and that my grieving mind is just playing tricks on me. I guessed being tormented by him was better than never seeing him again.

That night, she laid close to me. Our legs intertwined as she fell asleep against me, her arm across my chest. I missed her warmth so much. I thought his death had cooled her touch, but she was still so warm, so comforting. It was easy falling asleep that night with her against me, like a child and their favorite stuffed animal.

But I was stupid to forget that life isn’t unfair, it’s cruel. In the middle of the night, I was awoken by the cries over the baby monitor again. Only this time, as my eyes opened, I realized I couldn’t move anything else. My heart pounded as I drew in panicked breaths. My jaw merely trembled as I attempted to speak, pleas for help caught in my throat.

A tear streamed down the side of my face as I waited for my wife to wake up, but she didn’t. I was locked on that bed, unable to do nothing but listen to its cries. I wanted to scream, sob, punch a fucking wall, but I could do absolutely nothing. Suddenly, the speaker cut out, its cries halting with a staticy screech.

My trembling breaths filled the silent room as my body stayed frozen on the bed. I couldn’t even squeeze out a groan to try and wake her. Then, the sound of a door creaking open came from the hallway, and the cries began again. Not over the speaker, but from the hallway. Its cries sounded… distorted. They were deeper, more drawn out, and they sent goosebumps from head to toe.

I scrunched my eyes as I begged to be able to move, the crying nearing closer. Then, the bedroom door slowly opened, the deep cries filling up the room. I looked over at my wife, who was somehow still asleep. I wondered if this was even happening outside of my own head.

I couldn’t see it, but I could tell it was moving closer, and with each step its cries grew deeper. It reached the point that it sounded like it was gargling on its own blood. When it stood by my ear, its sobs were deafening. Now, I couldn’t move, and I couldn't hear anything besides this suffocating, dizzying crying that made me feel like I was drowning in molten tar.

“Dada,” it gurgled.

And just like that, I felt my entire body unlock, and a scream worth a thousand screams exited my mouth like a dam breaking open. The sound waves rippled my throat as I scatteredly threw myself off the bed and into the corner of the room.

“Jesus Christ!” My wife shouted as she finally woke up, ripping off her sleeping mask and turning the lamp on.

I let out wails of pure terror as I balled up in the corner, my body tremoring.

“My God, what happened?!”

“I- I- It- He was-“ I could barely squeeze a word out in between sobs.

“Jesus…”

She hopped off the bed and kneeled next to me, my body flinching as she reached for me.

“What happened?”

I slowly turned to her, my eyes gaping wide. Instead of saying a word, I stumbled to my feet and made my way out of the bedroom.

“Where are you going? What happened?! Jack!”

I ignored her calls as I threw the nursery door open. My eyes darted around as I searched for it, then realized it was in the crib.

“Jack, what are you doing… ?!”

“I’m not doing this anymore…”

“Jack, can we talk about this?!”

She gasped in horror as I yanked it out of the crib.

“YOU’RE RIGHT, OLIVIA! THIS ISN’T A DOLL! THIS… IS A FUCKING PARASITE! AND I WANT IT GONE!”

“JACK, PLEASE! THAT’S OUR SON!”

“NO, IT’S FUCKING NOT!”

She winced as I screamed.

“STOP! PLEASE!” She begged, tears pouring down her face as I began rapidly shaking it in front of her face.

“THIS! ISN’T! OUR! SON!”

Then, in one final burst of rage, I gripped it by its throat and slammed it to the ground with all of my might. In this moment, I realized that I learned two things from the death of my son.

Caskets aren’t supposed to be that small,

And reborn dolls aren’t supposed to have internal organs.

My wife crumbled to her knees as she let out those cries, the ones I could never forget. My breathing and heartbeat practically stopped, my body shutting down for a moment as I stared down at the spilled, greying organs and mushy skin that she attempted to cup in her trembling hands. I slowly looked up at her, utter horror hanging on my expression.

“Olivia… What is this… ?”

“He didn’t belong down there… He belongs with me… With us…”

Title: Some psychopath is trying to become TikTok famous at the expense of my daughter
Author: u/mtp6921

The world of TikTok and Snapchat and whatever other emerging social media platforms, that my 11 year old daughter watches has always been something, I found as being childish and didn’t interest me much.

However, when online news media outlets, like Yahoo and MSN would derive their stories from TikTok, then I said why not and at least give TikTok a try.

I was pleasantly surprised by TikTok on its numerous topics people post about everything from cats, to military, to true crime video posts.

Some of the posts on TikTok, I do find childish, but eventually TikTok has filtered them out and honed in on the things a 38 year old guy likes, like true crime mysteries.  I love watching videos on people who have mysteriously vanished or grainy footage of unknown suspects, who have never been caught.

So given that my daughter has just left a few hours ago for a weekend retreat at a Girls Scout camp, I decided to indulge on TikTok.

The old Girl Scout leader, Macy had gotten diagnosed with cancer, so she had to regrettably step down, but thankfully another mother has volunteered to step in as the new leader.

With my now separated wife, Sheila, who is still “trying to find herself,” I am just happy that my daughter, Grace has something to do this weekend, rather than just mope around the house feeling depressed.

The new leader, Carol was nice enough to pick up Grace, along with her own daughter, Raquel and another girl named Amanda, as well and drive them to a campground in the Poconos.

Carol sold me on her years of being involved with the Girl Scouts, so I’m going to do nothing more than relax this weekend.

I start to swipe through TikTok videos and find mostly crime related posts that I have seen already, so I decide to expand beyond the people I’m following to see what’s new on TikTok.

A post came up that caught my attention, because it said “Girl Scout tragic camping trip” that was posted by @serialkillerblossoms.  I really didn’t want to watch the video because I didn’t want to get paranoid and draw parallels to the possibility that something similar could happen to Grace on her current trip.

But whoever coined the phrase “curiosity killed the cat” probably was thinking of some numbskull like me.

I clicked on Part 1 of the video that was posted five days ago, which showed the outside of a small yellow unmarked school bus.  The creator of the video then showed the interior of the bus, which looked like your typical smaller bus with about six rows of seats.  The camera person pointed to various video cameras installed throughout the bus.  I wasn’t sure the intent of this Part 1 video.  I didn’t know if this bus was part of a crime that had happened in the past or just some type of converted recreational RV.

My interest was weaning, but I decided to click on Part 2 anyways.  

This time the bus was moving and I could make out kids on the back of the bus.  The video camera was by the driver and I couldn’t make out much more than there was about three kids sitting on the bus.  Then with just a few seconds left on the TikTok post, a different camera angle is shown.

As I’m sitting on my living room couch, I start to make out the faces of the kids. They appear to be middle school aged girls and something inside me tells me to look at when the video was posted, which was three hours ago.

When I see girls that are around my daughter’s age, I typically get a sense of empathy because whatever is going to happen in this series of TikTok posts, isn’t going to be good and I never want anything bad to happen to my daughter or anyone else’s kids.

But this time, my brain couldn’t get over a hump, because one of the girls looked spot on to Grace, however I didn’t want to commit to this theory, so I played Part 2 again.

Unfortunately, I can’t fast forward the video, so I have to wait again for the last few seconds.  As I’m waiting, my mind is going through the what if’s.  Most importantly what if that girl is actually my daughter?

As the video nears to its end and zooms in on the girls, my worst nightmare comes true as I take a screenshot of the video.  My daughter left wearing a Niagara Falls souvenir sweatshirt that she bought a few months ago.  Also, the two other girls look like Amanda and Raquel.

My thoughts instantaneously go to, why is my daughter sitting on a bus and not Carol’s car? And why is someone videotaping the girls?

I quickly click on Part 3 of the video series which was posted two hours ago.

This video shows the three girls still sitting on the bus, where each of the two other girls are sitting on the isle ends of the back seats and my daughter is sitting right in front of them.  I could tell right away by my daughter’s facial expressions that something isn’t right. Grace isn’t crying, but I could tell that she looks like she is confused and scared, where Raquel and Amanda have the same frightened facial expressions.

I really start to panic as I reach for my phone and attempt to call Carol. 

“I’m sorry this phone number your trying to reach is no longer in service, goodbye.”

“What the hell!” I say out loud in a confused tone.

Then, I try to call Grace’s phone which goes straight to voicemail.

I fall deeper into this nightmare as I frantically try to find the phone number for Amanda’s mother.  Grace’s mother, Sheila used to deal with all the Girl Scout issues, so I’m limited with contact information.  Luckily, I am able to get into Sheila’s email account, where I look for Girl Scout names and phone numbers.  I find Amanda’s name with her mother, Joy’s phone number, so I quickly dial the number.

“Hello, Joy! Listen this is Grace’s father, Ted.  Are you aware of Carol taking the girls on a little yellow bus to the camping trip?”

“No, Carol picked up Amanda in a blue Mercury Sable! Why do you think there on a bus?”

“Listen, your on your cell phone right now, Right?”

“Yes!”

“I’m going to send you a TikTok video, please watch the video and call me right back.”

“Sure, send the video!”

As I sent the video, I didn’t know what my next step should be, but calling 911 was definitely going to happen in the near future.

Within a couple of minutes, I get a return phone call from Joy.

“Ted what’s going on? Why is someone filming our daughters?” Joy said in a hurried frantic voice.

“I have no idea, but I don’t have a good feeling about this!”

“Did you try calling your sister Carol?”

“My sister? She ain’t my sister! She’s Raquel’s mother!”

“Ted, that woman Carol told me that she’s your sister, when I met her before the camping trip!”

“Well, She told me that she’s Raquel’s mother!”

“Oh my God! That woman isn’t Raquel’s mother!” Joy said in a perplexed tone.

“Oh God! Who is that psychopath?  You know that  Grace’s mother, Sheila used to go to all of the Girl Scout meetings, so I’m not familiar with all of the parents!”

“What do we do?”

“Im going to call the police!” I said.

“Okay and I’ll call Raquel’s mother!”

I’ve never called 911 before and I’m nervous to begin with, so calling 911 makes me even more nervous.

“911 - What’s your emergency?”

“My daughter went on a Girl Scout camping trip with two other girls and a woman ‘Carol’ who has seemed to have lied about her identity!”

“Okay so what’s the emergency?”

“I came across a TikTok video of someone posting the three girls on a little yellow bus and not the blue Mercury Sable that Carol picked them up with!”

“Okay, so what are the girls ages and what are they doing in the TikTok posts?”

“There around 11 years old and they all look nervous and scared!”

“Okay, so could they just be nervous from being away from home?”

“I suppose, but this woman ‘Carol’ lied to me and said that she is the mother of one of the girl’s, but she’s not!  She told one of the other mother’s that she is my sister which obviously isn’t true!”

“Okay, sir I’m going to send an officer over to your house because there’s kids involved, but we have a really busy night with a lot of things going on, so it might take a while for the police to show up to your house!”

“Wait! What? Why?” I responded.

“Listen sir, you haven’t told me anything that sounded like your daughter or the other girls are being harmed, so we have to prioritize our available police officers.”

“Listen, i didn’t give that woman permission to videotape my kid and I’m certain these girls have been kidnapped and I have no idea where they’re going!” I say in an angered tone.

“Well sir, I have a daughter that’s in the Girl Scouts and I have personally experienced when the leader’s are dealing with multiple parents, that sometimes things get lost in translation, so I wouldn’t rush to judgement yet!  All you have is your daughter on a TikTok video sitting on a bus going on a Girl Scout camping trip where she would understandably be nervous!”

“Listen, my house address is 664 Mockingbird lane! Hurry up and send someone over!” I said in an angered tone as I hung up the phone.

The video cameras on the bus are pointed in a direction so the viewers can’t see the outside of the bus, so I don’t even know if they’re heading to the Poconos.

it’s pretty much dark outside now which worries me even more.  It’s such a sinking feeling seeing that my daughter is in danger.

I look to see if Part 4 has been posted and it has, so I click on it.

Again the girls are being videotaped as they’re just sitting on the bus.  The unnerving thing is that none of the girls are talking to each other.  The three of them look like there completely petrified doing nothing more than just looking straight ahead.  The girls remind me of the war videos, I watch of D-day in how my daughter specifically had that same doomed look as the soldiers had, while they sat on the transport boats waiting to storm the heavily entrenched beaches.

The video was posted less than an hour ago and this video is darker than the others, so I could tell that the video was actually taken about an hour ago.

My phone starts to vibrate as I see that it’s Joy calling.

“Hey Joy Listen, I called 911 and they’re sending someone over but apparently they have more pressing issues!”

“More pressing issues! What the hell is more important than three girls being kidnapped?”

“The 911 operator thinks that a crime hasn’t necessarily been committed or that this isn’t an emergency situation.  She thinks the girls could just be looking nervous because their scared about going on a camping trip and being away from their parents!”

“Well who the hell gave that ‘Carol’ permission to videotape my daughter and post the video on TikTok and who the hell is ‘Carol’? And why is she using @serialkillerblossoms as a username?”

“You know, I was so frustrated with the 911 operator that I didn’t even mention her username, but I doubt that wouldn’t of made a difference.  @serialkillerblossoms is a new account and only had the four videos posted.  There’s not too many people, who have viewed the videos so far, which is good because I don’t want them to be taken down for violating a TikTok policy!”

“Ted, I really don’t have a good feeling about this!  Should I drive to the Poconos to the Red Squirrel campground?”

“The thing is, you can but I’m not sure If the bus is even going to that campground or even to the Poconos!  The campground is less than two hours away, so they should of been there already!”

“So what should we do?” Joy asks me, while I can hear her crying over the phone.

“Who is this ‘Carol’ person?”  I ask.

“I really have no idea!  When Macy got diagnosed with cancer, her story was plastered everywhere on Facebook and the fire company even had a fund raising dinner for her to cover her medical expenses! So she could just be some random psychopath that came across Macy’s story and figured ‘hey this is my opportunity to kidnap some kids!’”

“What is her motivation? Is she trying to get TikTok famous?”

“Getting TikTok famous for kidnapping girls and taking them on a camping trip?” Joy said while still crying.

That’s when it dawned on me the naive mindset that Joy was having. I’m guessing she hasn’t seen the countless videos of the horrible-ness this world has to offer, like the idea that there’s people who kill just for some type of sick fun, like that eerie picture of the notorious serial killer, John Wayne Gacy, who is dressed up as a clown for a kids performance.  Joy hasn’t paid attention to the fact the hashtags #serialkiller and #crimevideo were used in the video posts, hence why they came to my video feed.

If I thought that this ‘Carol’ person was just videotaping them going camping, I probably would be a little mad, however nothing about her actions or the videos point to her future actions as being harmless.

While I’m on the phone with Joy, I see Part 5 has been posted.

“Listen Joy, Part 5 has been posted, so I’m going to hang up and watch it. I pray the girls are alright.  Try to find any possible information about that ‘Carol’ woman, Bye!”

I really didn’t want to play Doctor Phil with Joy as I know my daughter’s faith rests in the hands of these video posts.

I click on Part 5 and besides the light from the video camera, I could tell that it’s pitch black outside.  The video camera pans the surroundings area, as I see a thick Forrest with nothing more than trees.  I haven’t seen the girls yet, so my heart is beating double time. 

The camera eventually shows a makeshift campsite with a small fire burning. Based on the remoteness of the surroundings, I’m certain that the video is not of the Red Squirrel campground and is probably in some very remote area, based on the thickness of the forest.

The camera turns it’s attention to the small fire pit and then to a small two person tent.  I can hear the camera person breathing heavy as she walks towards the tent.

Every single inch of me is experiencing absolute terror as I don’t know what’s inside the tent, because so far I’ve seen no signs of Grace or the other two girls.

The tent slowly opens up and I start breathing to the point where I could go into convulsions at any moment.

As the tent is opened, I let out  a sigh of relief, as I see the three girls are partially sitting up in the cramped tent, but then my heart sinks to my feet as I see there helpless facial expressions.

I focus in on Grace, as I see that her eyes are watery.  She looks like she had seen the inner belly of hell and is too terrified to move.  The camera moves from left to right as I notice the two other girls have the same petrified face as Grace.  

Not a single word is said in the video and I feel angry and completely helpless as I scream out “don’t you fucking harm my daughter you son of a bitch!” Then the video ends.

Title: I think my old bedtime story has a more sinister meaning
Author: u/Pudenator

Every night, my Dad was in charge of putting me to bed. He would help me brush my teeth and then would tuck me into my nice, warm bed. Then he would tell me a story. Every night, it was the same story. ‘*The Story of Bosco and Billy’*. I had lots of books in my room, as my Mother would read to me throughout the day, but Dad would never read any of those books, he would always tell me the same story. I always assumed that either, the story had come from a book, but my Father had told it so many times that he didn’t need to read from the book anymore, or that it was a story he was told as a child. 

I always enjoyed ‘*The Story of Bosco and Billy’,* I always found that it would help me go to sleep. Usually, I would be almost asleep by the end of the story. I slowly learnt all of the words to the story and would sometimes recite it along with my Dad. For some reason, probably because I heard it every night for years, the story stuck with me and even to this day, I still remember all of the words to the story. 

The story, in its entirety, is as follows:

*Billy the Bear was an ordinary bear, with an ordinary life*

*But he had a small friend named Bosco, who got him into strife*

*Most of the time Bosco would behave, but sometimes he acted out*

*Billy tried to keep him in line, but sometimes he would break out*

*Like, one-time Bosco was hungry and decided he would steal food*

*Billy tried to stop him and explained to Bosco that stealing is rude*

*But Bosco didn’t listen, he stole the food anyway*

*And took it to his secret spot and hid it away*

*Bosco took the food to the large oak tree that was in the woods*

*There he stuffed the food inside and that’s where he hid his goods*

*Billy never found the stolen food, its still hidden there to this day*

*Bosco wishes that it is never found, he hopes, and he prays*

*Billy is kind and Bosco is a little bit silly*

*And that is the story of Bosco and Billy*

Now, the story seems innocent enough, and I always thought it was a cute little story about two bears, but after recent events, I now know it is a lot more sinister than it first appears.

My Dad passed away a few years ago, and it took a toll on all of us, my Mum especially. She began a little bit reclusive after my Father passed and so I didn’t see her as often, because she shut herself off from others. I spent a long time trying to create a relationship with my Mother again, and slowly, over the course of a couple of years, I did manage to reconnect with her. Things weren’t as they once were, but she did invite me over once a week for a cup of coffee. During these hour-long visits, we would sit in the kitchen and talk about times gone by. About my childhood, about my time at school and about all of the good times we had together. The one subject that didn’t come up, however, was my Father. I think the pain was still too raw for my Mum to talk about him.

On one of my weekly visits, though, I thought that I would try and mention my Father, as I felt that it might do Mum some good to talk about him. I decided to mention the story that he would tell me every night. 

*Do you remember that story Dad used to tell me before bed, ‘The Story of Billy and Bosco?’,* I hesitantly asked, not knowing how Mum would react to the mention of her late husband.

Mum looked up from her cup of coffee that she was drinking. She looked confused. Maybe because it was the first time he had been mentioned for a number of years, or maybe because she didn’t know what I was talking about.

*“No, I don’t remember that story”* she replied, *“You had a lot of books, so I can’t remember all of them”.* 

I was a bit surprised by this. Dad told it to me every night, so I would have thought that she would remember it. I then went on to explain that it wasn’t a book, it was a story that would recite, without reading it off of a page, because he knew it so well. 

*“I thought that your Father would read you a different book each night”* she said, sounding confused, “*That’s what he always told me anyway”.*

I thought that this was especially strange because he never read me one of my books, and I would have thought that my own Mother would have known this. 

*“What was this story about?”* she asked me.

“*It was about two bears, one named Billy and one named Bosco”.* 

I was about to continue explain the story when my Mum suddenly interrupted me.

“*Did you just say the bear was named Bosco?”,* she asked me, sounding quite serious.

*“Yeah, that’s right. His name was Bosco”,* I replied.

*“That’s strange”,* Mum said. She had a look on her face, that looked like she was trying to remember something.

“*Your Father used to tell me about a friend that he used to have named Bosco”,* Mum continued, “*He used to say that Bosco would get him in a lot of trouble when he was younger. I never met this Bosco, which your Dad said was a good thing. He also said that he only met up with Bosco only once or twice after we met, and then your Father told me that he was no longer going to see Bosco. He said that he finally got rid of him. I was always curious as to who he was, I have never seen any photos of him, or any evidence that he existed, now that I think about it. So, it is strange that he told you a story that contained a character with the name Bosco”.* 

Mum stopped talking for a second and I didn’t know how to respond. She then looked at me and asked, *“Do you remember this story? Can you tell it to me?”.*

I recited the entire story to her. She listened to the whole tale without changing her expression. She took it all in and then she asked, “*An oak tree? Are you sure that Bosco hid the food in an old oak tree in the woods?”.* 

*“Yeah, it was definitely an old oak tree. Why’s that?”* I asked her, sensing that something wasn’t quite right. 

“*It’s just that, on mine and your Fathers first date, he took me to an old oak tree that was inside the Shelton Woods, only a ten-minute drive from here”* she responded, “*He told me then, that it was lucky for me that Bosco hadn’t decided to interrupt their date”.* 

She then stopped talking and stared at the wall behind where I was sitting. 

“*I think it is time for you to go now, I’m sorry”,* she told me, a hint of sadness in her voice.

I thought that maybe it was for the best that I did leave. I got up and gave her a small hug, which she didn’t even seem to notice, then I collected my things and headed out the front door. I got into my car and begun to drive home. On the way home, however, the thought of the old oak tree and Bosco, began to fill my head. I couldn’t escape these thoughts, I didn’t know what it all meant, if it meant anything at all. I don’t know what compelled me, but I had to visit the Shelton Woods and find this oak tree. I turned my car around and headed in the direction of the woods.

Fifteen minutes later, I found myself standing at the edge of the woods. I took a step forward and entered them. I didn’t know exactly where this oak tree was, but I was determined to find it. I explored the woods for around ten minutes before I saw it. Standing in front of me was a huge oak tree, its branches extending high up into the sky. I walked over to the base of the tree; a sense of fear started to overcome me. Something didn’t feel right. It felt like something terrible had happened here. I looked down at the ground, at the base of the tree and I saw that the dirt there looked slightly different than the rest of the dirt in the woods. I don’t know why I did this, but I bent down and begun to dig in this dirt.

The police say that if I hadn’t started digging, then they probably never would have found them. There were four bodies in total. All young women around the age of twenty-four. All of them had been dead for over thirty years. It was undeniable, they were all murdered and buried under this tree. The DNA testing was also clear. My father was responsible for the killings. Somehow, he managed to keep all of this hidden for many years. He never told anyone. The only clues that he gave were through my bedtime story, which I think was his way of confessing. The only thing I am not sure of now is, who is Bosco? Maybe my Father and Bosco are the same person, or maybe he really did have a friend with that name. I don’t think we will ever know. I don’t think I want to know.

Title: My friend works for the city’s CCTV archives and has seen some disturbing things

I hadn’t seen Mike in a few months. He’d been buried in work and our usual weekend nights out had about disappeared.

Then he called me on a Thursday and invited me over for drinks. I jumped at the invite. But took note of how depressed he sounded on the phone. 

By the time I got there Mike had already started drinking and was slurring his words. A dark cloud seemed to hover over him, which got worse as we drank. I finally asked what’d been going on with him. 

Mike turned darker. Afraid. He said it had to do with work. 

I never really knew what Mike did for a living. I did know he worked for the city in the tech department, and was involved with the CCTV surveillance network. But I never knew what his day to day operations were… which he began to describe in detail.

Mike explained there were thousands of cameras scattered throughout the downtown core, outlying neighbourhoods and well into the suburbs of our one million plus city. His responsibility was to categorize and archive all the incoming footage. 

Most of the footage went into very general classifications and were saved in hard-drive farms and identified with a lengthy combination of numbers and letters for categorical archiving. They were truly meant to be forgotten about. 

It was an expansive task, but Mike designed and built an AI screening program that detected common patterns in footage, then sectioned out anomalous behaviour for review. 

The vast majority wasn’t noteworthy. Something like 99.99%. 

Then there was the .01%. The car accidents. Assaults. Swarming’s. Rapes. Abductions. Murders. Those went into a special archive for use in criminal investigations. 

And then… there was the .0001%. They were held in a classified archive and contained footage capturing events that for all accounts were… unexplainable. This was called the Tartarus Archive. 

I looked up the word ‘Tartarus’ after and discovered it was one of the darkest, deepest prisons from Greek Mythology. It was said that if you dropped an anvil from heaven, it would take seven days for it to reach the Earth. It would take another seven days for the anvil to reach Tartarus. It was the place you sent Titans when there was nowhere else that could contain them. 

When Sisyphus was condemned to an eternity of futility and frustration with a large boulder and a mountain slope, that punishment was carried out in Tartarus. 

As it turned out, the name was quite fitting to the archive's growing contents. 

Some footage could be simplified to strange optical anomalies in the camera and coincidences of light or crackheads on a bender through the subway systems. Other footage*,* though, defied logic. 

The *others* are what captured Mike’s mind that evening. He’d been breaking protocol and bringing hard drives home at night. In fact, he’d been splicing the footage together, capturing and compiling repeat aberrations and editing them into linear sequences.  

Mike wanted to show me some. It wasn’t in a bragging or showing off kind of way. It felt more like the sharing of a heavy burden kind of way. I asked if showing me would get him in trouble, but he waved the idea away. 

I said yeah, *obviously* I want to see what’s going on in my city. 

Mike led me into his work room, where he had monitors and towers and piles of externals set up. We sat down and he skimmed through some drives nervously. 

Then he landed on one. 

Mike told me this anomaly was codenamed Lincoln Specter. He pressed play. 

On the largest screen, black and white footage started up, showing Lincoln Avenue, one of our less attractive downtown streets, at 3 a.m. The camera angle showed the length of Lincoln Ave. as it led into the downtown core. 

The street appeared empty and quiet. 

From a side road, a woman emerged, walking towards the camera. As she approached the intersection, she turned over her shoulder and appeared to scream. 

The woman took off, sprinting passed the camera, which cut to a new, wider angle from another camera across the street. 

We watched the woman running frantically, seemingly being chased. 

But she was the only one on the street. There was no one else anywhere around her.

The woman kept screaming as she ran, and the cameras kept following, cutting between different CCTV angles. 

We watched as the woman was chased into the middle of an empty intersection. She fell, then cowered as if something massive was standing over her. 

The woman’s neck stiffened and she began to levitate off the ground. Her body looked like a rag doll as something lifted her by the throat until she was floating, a dozen feet above the road, in the middle of the intersection. 

Then the woman’s head snapped to the left and her body fell back to the ground. The video ended and went black. 

I sat shocked. 

Mike saw my expression and said, “You ain’t seen nothing yet.”

I asked if that was real. If what I saw was unaltered. Was raw footage. 

Mike said all he’d done was put the clips together, none of the content had been touched. He told me he found out the incident ended up being described as a hit and run, and the case was left figuratively open for more evidence to amass. Which it never would. The department kept the footage hidden, claiming it was a camera malfunction. 

No one outside of Mike and his boss had seen the video of how the poor woman actually died. 

I started to understand the air of sombreness Mike was carrying around. 

Mike started the next video. This one was codenamed Black Crab, and was much longer than the previous one. 

It started in the subway systems, at the underground Walkley station, shortly after closing up for the night. Walkley was the last stop on the route, and the exterior was shouldered by a new housing development on one side and untouched forest and swampland on the other. 

The camera was pointed down along the subway platform on the east side, and showed its entire length with benches and garbage cans populating it. At the far end, the tunnel was filled with darkness. 

The lights on the platform shut off and the station went dark. The camera switched to night vision and everything became visible again.

My eyes trained on the platform, waiting for something to happen. 

Finally, there was movement. It was coming from the tunnel. It was difficult to identify what exactly it was at first, as its movements were strange and the footage was grainy. 

But it got closer to the camera and I got a better look. 

It resembled a human. A man. But he was walking on his hands and feet. Upside down. With his back arched and his stomach pointed to the ceiling. He had long, dark hair that dragged along the ground and he wore tattered layers of old jackets and torn pants.

He moved like a crab, jerkily yet quickly and easily as he made his way to the staircase. 

The footage cut to a new camera in the dark hallway leading to the stairs out of the station. We watched the crab walker claw up two steps at a time, and then crawl over the turnstiles and towards the exit. 

The footage cut again, now showing the exterior of the station entrance. The crab walker squeezed and twisted and maneuvered his body through the locked and closed entrance gate. It looked impossible to accomplish. But he did it. 

Once outside, the crab walker eyed his surroundings before skittering off towards the woods and disappearing. 

The footage cut to an hour later and revealed the crab walker reappearing from the woods. He was dragging a small animal by the tail in his teeth. The animal looked like a cat. 

The crab walker squeezed back through the gate, crawled through the station, and disappeared into the subway tunnel. 

Again, Mike saw my expression and told me there was more. He showed me the length of the video, which was over an hour long. Mike had compiled over twenty sequences of the crab walker creeping out of the subway station and into the woods. 

Mike skimmed through the video towards the end and we watched the crab walker come out of a sewer in a downtown alleyway. It crawled over to a pile of garbage bags and cardboard boxes. Then it jumped into them and some kind of vicious frenzy ensued. 

There was someone else in the pile of garbage. Hands and feet thrashed about as they were struggling for their life. 

Then the movement stopped and the hands and feet went still. The crab walker’s body moved jerkily about, but I couldn’t see what was happening because of the darkness and all the garbage bags and boxes obscuring the camera’s view. 

Mike leaned over to me and whispered that the crab walker was eating a homeless man. 

This caused a criminal investigation as the dead body was found mutilated and festering in the open alleyway. 

Mike followed up on the inquiry. What he discovered was the crab walker was who authorities believed to be a man named David Fletcher. 

Decades ago, David had been a prominent lawyer with a family. One Christmas, there was a house fire and his wife and kids were killed in the blaze. It was David’s fault. He lost everything, including his mind. 

Everyone has a breaking point, whether they know it or not. A place where they bend too far and then snap. 

David found his. 

Family and friends described his descent as nightmarish. David lived on the streets, became addicted to drugs and tumbled into mental illness. The last anyone knew of him was from ten years prior. He’d thrown himself in front of a subway at the Walkley station, and no one heard from or saw him again. 

It appeared that, somehow… David had survived the subway hit. His back had broken and healed strangely, causing him to move the way he did. He’d adapted to the new posture and lived in the darkness of the subway tunnels, finding sustenance from drain water and the wild animals he caught.  

That was what Mike found out, at least. But then he said… *that* was just the answer the investigators gave in discovery. Who knows where the truth lay? Mike said there was always an answer for the videos he saw. Whether the answers were true or not, no one knew. But the ones that had to become public all needed explanations, however absurd. 

Either way, David was never found and didn’t reappear on the subway footage.

Mike plugged a new hard drive in. He poured a fresh drink and told me this was the one that was troubling him. 

The file was code-named Cloud Mirror. 

I wasn’t sure I wanted to see it, but before I could object, Mike pressed play. 

All the monitors lit up with footage from different intersections downtown, on the exact date and time as each other. There were five in total. 

The streets on each screen were empty and quiet. No cars or people. 

Suddenly, at the exact same time in the centre of the intersections, a small glow pulsed into existence. 

It was some kind of orb, roughly the size of a bowling ball. The street lights around it pulsed with energy waves as the orb grew larger. It grew to the size of a beach ball.

Then it flashed out. The street lights went back to normal and the intersection was as lifeless as it was before. 

I asked Mike what they were. He told me he had gigs of footage of the orbs and had watched them repeatedly. He didn’t know what they were. At first. Then they started to change.

Mike clicked onto the next video. Again, the five monitors lit up with the same intersections and time of night, but several weeks later. 

The street lights glowed and pulsed and an orb manifested into existence again. It grew to its beach ball size… but then altered its surface and glow. Something gas-like replaced it, growing outward into a couch-sized cloud of dark grey. 

One of the cameras was closer, so I got to see the small clouds in detail. It looked like a volcanic eruption wrapping around itself. They were large, constantly morphing blobs that curled outward from a glowing centre, resembling a mandelbulb fractal as a gaseous based organism. 

It was fascinating to see them floating in the middle of the street, so alien to our roads and stop lights and street lamps. 

Then they began to move. 

Gliding down empty roads. The cameras cut to different angles, following the clouds on some unknown path, zigging and zagging onto new streets and through alleyways. 

Then they’d stop. 

The clouds hovered in the centre of their intersection. They’d lower to ground level, standing straight up like a large coffin. Holding rigid to the shape, their exteriors continued to shift and mold together like magnets made of smoke. 

Something on one of the monitors caught my eye. 

Down the street, people appeared. They’d seen the cloud and were walking towards it. The group looked drunk and fascinated by the floating entity. So much so, they were approaching it. As they did, the cloud became brighter. The street lamps around it pulsed. 

The group were in some kind of trance, staring into the morphing blob. One of the group, a guy, stared into it like a zombie, then walked right into the cloud and disappeared. 

None of the group tried to stop him. Instead… another one followed him in. And another. And another. All five members of the group disappeared in the cloud. 

Then they reappeared. One at a time. The guy first. Then in the order they went in. 

Only… they weren’t stumbling and boisterous and drunk now. They were walking upright. Using minimal movements. They formed in a perfect five person circle for several seconds over quick words, then turned and all went in separate directions. Their strides, arm swings and speed all matched. 

Another monitor showed a similar situation with a larger group of people, lost in reverie as they marched, one after another, into the cloud. 

Each monitor showed the same thing now. People entering the clouds and coming back out. 

Different. 

Mike stopped the video. I asked him if he’d shown this to anyone else. He said he hadn’t. Not even to his one boss. Which was a problem. Because he had a meeting with his boss in the morning to discuss the missing footage. 

I asked why he didn’t show the footage to his boss. This footage seemed more than serious. People were being replaced by something. 

Mike sighed and put a new video on. 

The main monitor lit up and showed a new downtown street. The date was from earlier this week. One of the clouds was floating in the intersection. A middle-aged couple were walking nearby, the husband with a slight limp in his right leg. 

The couple saw the cloud and were sucked in by its aura. They approached it, eyes wide and mouths open. 

Both the husband and wife entered the cloud and disappeared. After a moment, they reappeared. The husband’s limp was gone. 

Mike turned to me and said, “That was my boss and his wife.”

Title: How I exposed the vile underbelly of TikTok
Author: u/mtp6921

I became infatuated with a blonde girl on TikTok named Chloe.  So much so that I would watch her live streaming content on a daily basis for the past month.

She did nothing more but hold her phone in her hand while laying in her bed and respond to mostly men’s instant messages.

I always thought it was kind of pathetic but the girl was very attractive and was way out of my league and she would actually respond to my messages when she was streaming live.

Sometimes there would be 150 people watching her live streaming then other days there would be only 8 people viewing, who were mostly guys.

Tonight is a slow night for her, where she only had 8 viewers, but then again it’s 2:00 a.m., where most people are sleeping.

As 2:15 a.m. approached she hit an all time low of having only 4 viewers, which I didn’t mind because then I would be the focal point of her attention.

I always thought that she was alone in her room when she was streaming live, however I just heard something deeply disturbing that wasn’t meant to be heard by her viewers.  

I heard a male voice whisper “do something!”

Where Chloe’s face looked really fearful after hearing the male voice and she said “come on guys come back.  What can I do to make you guys not leave?”

“What do you mean?” I messaged her.

“Oh I just want everyone to have fun and keep watching me” she typed back.

She couldn’t get her viewers up this early in the morning so she said “Good night everyone!” Then her live streaming was disconnected.

I was a little bummed out that Chloe ended her live session so I browsed TikTok to see if any other girls were streaming live.

Then I came across another attractive blonde, who’s name is Livy, so I joined her live session.  She too had a low viewer count because it was so late at night.

I typed in “Hi Livy! How are you doing tonight?“

“I’m fine. I’m just hanging out!”

“That’s cool! How old are you?”

“I’m 20 years old!” Livy responded.

Then I heard a faint male voice say “Show more of your chest!” Where Livy’s face went from
relaxed to looking very uncomfortable fairly quick.

The male voice seemed eerily similar to the voice on Chloe’s live session.

Livy pulled down on her dress, without exposing her nipples, which drew in more people who were casually scrolling through TikTok and within a minute her viewer count went up significantly to the point where she couldn’t answer everyone’s questions.

Livy looked uncomfortable exposing most of her chest.

As I started to look at Livy’s bedroom, where she was filming her live session from, I noticed that when she pointed her phone’s camera to the ceiling that it was the same ceiling fan and unusual octantal ceiling shape as Chloe’s room.  

I thought to myself that what are the chances that someone has the same exact ceiling fan and the same highly unusual ceiling layout?

So I continued to watch Livy’s live session to pick up on other characteristics of her room, then I said “what the hell!” out loud when I saw that Livy had the same dresser and her closet was in the same place as Chloe’s.

“This is the same room as Chloe’s!” I said out loud.

Being that I’m 31 years old and older than most of the other male viewers on TikTok, I’m probably the only person who cares enough to pick up on the room similarities to the point where it’s undeniably the same bedroom.

I always thought these young women were just doing these live sessions for fun, while hoping to make some extra money, however this is the first time that I thought something really sinister was going on.

I  thought to myself,
Why would Chloe leave her bedroom so another young woman could pretend that it’s her bedroom to start another live streaming session? 

There was no other logical explanation other than these girls were working in shifts and were more than likely being forced to do these live sessions.

Something else that irked me was when a male viewer would jokingly type into Chloe’s live session “I’ll pay you, if I can come over to hang out with you?”

Where Chloe would respond to those offensive comments with “Send me a private message,” which I previously had thought was just a joke, but now I’m assuming that these girls are unwillingly prostituting themselves out. 

So I typed in “I’ll pay you, if I can come over to hang out with you?” into Livy’s life streaming session.

Like clockwork she responded back  “Send me a private message.”

So I sent the private message and Livy responded “Where do you live?”

“I live in Pennsylvania!”

“Oh, I’ll be in Maryland in two weeks from now!” Livy messaged me back.

“That’s not horribly far from Pennsylvania.  Can I see you if I drive to Maryland?” I responded.

“Sure if the price is right -lol.” Livy responded.

“How about $200?”

“Umm, I think I’ll be too busy when I visit Maryland to see you!”

“How about $500?”

“I think I can find the time to see you - lol.”

“Ok, how do I send you the money then?”

“Send the $500 to this PayPal account that I’ll copy and paste in a second and then I’ll send you the address and time, when you can see me.”

Once again, I thought this conduct was really unusual and I doubted that the person who I sent the private message to was actually Livy, but was more than likely that guy who I heard in the background.

I thought to myself $500 is a good amount of money, but is also a figure that most young men could come up with.

The most obvious thing to do was wait until Chloe came on her live session tomorrow and ask her the same question of “can I come see you?”

I woke up the next day and went to work, then I came home and waited for Chloe to come on.

I logged onto TikTok with one of my dummy accounts and eventually she logged onto her live session.

I waited a few minutes then I typed in “I’ll pay you, if I can come over to hang out with you?”

Where Chloe typed in the same phrase as Livy did “Send me a private message.” 

I went through the same back and forth messaging where I almost couldn’t believe it when “Chloe” messaged me that she will be in Maryland in two weeks and I had to pay her $500 to get an address and a time.

I now had the disgusting feeling that these young women were somehow being trafficked, so I paid the $500 to both Chloe’s and Livy’s PayPal accounts and unsurprisingly, I was given the same Comfort Inn hotel address in Glen Burnie, Maryland, but with different hotel rooms and different times.

I now was on a mission to uncover how many young women were being exploited on TikTok, so I continually sent the  “I’ll pay you, if I can come over to hang out with you?” message on different TikTok dummy accounts that I had created.

Amazingly, five other girls said that they were going to be in Maryland in two weeks. I didn’t feel it was necessary to spend the $500 to get the actual address and time.  

So I waited the two weeks then I drove to Maryland and waited in the hotel parking lot where I could see both of the hotel rooms that Chloe and Livy had given me.

I was about five hours early from seeing Livy which was the first room and time that I was given to see.

As I waited in the parking lot, I saw something extremely appalling, where a bunch of younger guys would drive into the parking lot and get out of their cars and then knock on predetermined hotel doors, about once an hour, to include Chloe’s and Livy’s hotel room, where the hotel door would open and the young guy’s would go in.

Seeing car after car pull into the  hotel parking lot, then seeing some guy get out of his car and head to a predetermined hotel room, kind of reminded me of the same visuals of watching countless people get out of their cars to go into a Blockbuster, back in the day or watching guys get out of their cars to go into a strip club, because of the shear endless volume of guys that would continually enter and exit the parking lot.

I figured there must be at least 30 different hotel rooms and this hotel was purposely selected because of its large parking lot and the ability for someone to watch from the parking lot at the various rooms that were being utilized by the TikTok girls.

I noticed that there were three cars in the parking lot where each car had a guy that was constantly watching the traffic coming in and out of the hotel rooms.  These guys definitely looked like shady characters and weren’t cops.

Eventually my time came to go to Livy’s hotel room so I got out of my car, where I felt a sense of nervous enthusiasm to see what was actually going on.

I knocked on Livy’s door and she answered the door. Right away, I could tell that was really high on some type of substance which might of been from crack or ecstasy.

Livy definitely didn’t have the same personality that she displayed on TikTok.

She actually handed me a condom within five minutes where I almost threw up from the vileness that was occurring.

Livy was so out of it, that I couldn’t even hold a conversation with her and I could tell that she was brainwashed not to ask for help or anything along those lines.

I saw enough of what I needed to see and I gave the condom back to her, then I went back to my car.

I felt a complete sense of disgust and sleaziness come over me, where I couldn’t even get out of my car two hours later to see Chloe during my assigned time.

I decided to just hang out in the parking overnight and see what would happen in the morning.  

The next morning at about 8:00 a.m. a large commercial Martz passenger bus pulled into the driveway which woke me up from my dead sleep.

At about 8:15 a.m. each TikTok  girl was being pushed out of her hotel room by some unknown guy who went from room to room.

At about 9:00 a.m., I saw about 50 girls get onto the bus which nearly made me throw up.

Then the bus pulled away and I decided to follow the bus.

The bus eventually got onto Interstate I-80 west and it just kept driving and driving where I almost fell asleep behind the wheel.

I tried to stay far away back from the bus so the drive wouldn’t know that I was following it and I had to get gas at the same time which I used the same caution and fueled up away from the bus.

After almost 20 hours of painstaking driving, the bus got off I-80 and stopped in this hole in the wall town in Wyoming called Rock Springs.

The bus drove outside of the town and into this large compound that reminded me of the David Koresh compound that the authorities tried to overtake in Waco, Texas.

I didn’t pull into the compound for fear of my own life so I just took down the coordinates and then went back to the town of Rock Springs, where I pulled into a gas station.

Because of the magnitude that was going on in that compound, I decided that I couldn’t trust the local authorities and instead I contacted the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

Agent Sipkowitz took down the information that I had provided and she seemed equally as shocked as I was regarding the magnitude of the operation.

Agent Sipkowitz told me that she would contact me if any additional information was needed from me.

The next day Chloe and Livy didn’t log onto their TikTok live accounts, so I typed Rock Springs into Google’s recent news stories and I saw a story about an overnight raid that had occurred, where I saw the photo of the compound in Rock Springs and the title read “A potential human trafficking operation was uncovered ...”

Title: Never sleep in your car on a road trip
Author: u/One_Planche_Man
Upvotes: 641
Link: https://reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/wf7omq/never_sleep_in_your_car_on_a_road_trip/

I'm from Connecticut. I was in a long-distance relationship with a girl from Georgia, and would often make road trips down to visit her. I don't really mind; I love road trips. I've driven across the United States and back, all on my own. There's just something about travelling the highways of the US by yourself that's just so freeing.

To save money, I would sleep in my car. It's not so bad, it's basically camping...in a metal tent. Makes you feel like you're really "roughin’ it". I just recline the seat back, keep the key in the ignition just in case, and doze off. No, I don't put anything up to block the windows for privacy. Maybe I should have.

The trip down South is a comfortable two-day drive. My stop would usually be somewhere along the Virginia-North Carolina border. So, for my previous trip, that's exactly where I stopped that night. Rest stops were often less trafficked and thus quieter, than truck stops. Normally I would have stopped at a Love's, but I was so tired that I settled for the first rest stop I saw. It was oddly vacant that night, with only a couple lone cars sitting forlorn under the amber street lamps. Most likely travelers with the same idea as myself.

I pulled into a parking spot away from the others, under the shadow of a tree and far from the street lamps. I figured I would have more privacy there as opposed to being bathed in light. So, I did my usual thing, locked my doors, opened the window just a hair for ventilation, kept my key in, reclined the seat, and went to sleep. I was never interrupted on any of these "car camping" nights. So I never suspected anything on this one.

Then a sharp tap woke me up. At first, I thought I had heard it in my dream. I opened my eyes, a bit confused. Since I was leaned back, I was facing the ceiling and couldn't see anything. I hear another tap. Like a tiny object hitting a hard surface. It came in an irregular rhythm. Was it raining? Was water dripping onto my windshield? I'm under a tree, maybe something fell from the branches. Maybe a squirrel or a bird was dropped something. What if a squirrel was climbing around my car? Or what if it wasn't an animal...?

The thought occurred to me that it might very well be a person poking around outside. What did they want? Were the doors locked? Yes. The keys were in the ignition, I can leave in an instant. Still, I lay there, completely still, pretending to be asleep. Pretending I hadn't heard anything. Hoping whoever it was, they would leave me alone. It was better to not find out. I was too afraid to find out. It was better to stay here in blissful ignorance.

Still the tapping continued. I had to do something. There was no way I was just going to stay there. I had to look. My heart was pounding. In that moment, it was deafeningly loud. Whoever was out there could probably hear it.

I decided. I was going to look. I was going to raise my head up and see what was making the noise. So that's what I did.

What met my eyes sent a jolt through entire body. Every muscle fiber locked up in pure shock at what I saw. The faint glow of the street lamps cast just enough light for me to make out what I looking at. There in the windshield, staring directly at me, was a face. Someone, I presumed to be a woman, was lying on my hood, her face pressed right up against my windshield. Her face was completely still, locked in a permanent grin. I froze in overwhelming terror. The eyes I stared into appeared to have rolled back, showing only the whites. The nose was turned up, pressed painfully into the glass. The lips stretched wide, revealing horrid rotten teeth. Even in the darkness, I could tell her skin was sickly pale, contrasting her long, filthy black hair.

Whoever this was, she was clearly not in her right mind. I don't know how long I sat there, too afraid to move. Finally, I got a grip on myself and shot my hand to the ignition. It turned over, making, in that instant, the most beautiful sound I ever heard. (For a split second, I was afraid I might be caught in a horror movie scenario, the one where the car won't crank as the killer approaches.)

I reversed as fast as I could, trying not to give this creeper time to try anything. In my panic, I remember activating the windshield wipers in a futile attempt to get her off. I thought, was I about to drive out of here with some wacko holding onto my hood?? Thankfully, I didn't have to worry about that, because as soon as I stopped, the woman leapt off, landing on all fours.

Seeing my opportunity, I shifted into 'drive' and gunned it, right as I saw her reaching for the driver's side door. With my foot on the gas, I sped out of the parking lot. Behind me, I heard her let out a piercing shriek like that of an animal. I looked in my rearview mirror and for a split second I thought I saw her chasing me, running on all fours, her black hair swinging wildly around her.

I couldn't get a good look, as I rounded a curve in the road leading out of the rest stop and merged with the highway. There, I picked up speed, and drove through the night. I did not dare stop again until I saw the morning light.

Title: My Mom died suddenly about four months ago, but that wasn’t the worst thing.
Author: u/1000andonenites

My Mom died quite suddenly and unexpectedly of a hospital infection about four months ago, but that, if you can believe it, wasn’t the worst thing.   
   
Nor was the fact that her younger sister, my aunt, took up with Dad less than two months after her death.   
   
The worst was yet to come.   
   
It started on a dull evening- I just had supper with my aunt and Dad, barely tolerating her bright friendly chatter about school. I went upstairs to my room as soon as I could to “do my homework”. I stared at my laptop screen, pretending to look at my assignment, but in reality I was swimming in grief and missing Mom. I couldn’t concentrate on anything since she died.   
   
I minimised the assignment tab, and looked at the photo I used as background. It was taken a few years ago- a happy family occasion, my Mom and aunt sitting side-by-side, so like yet unlike, my dad next to Mom and I was leaning against him. All of us were smiling, Mom had both her arms stretched out around her sister and her husband.   
   
The chatbox in the bottom left-hand corner of my screen began flashing. I was mildly surprised- it was an older app that no one really used anymore- I had been meaning to delete it.   
   
And then, I froze.   
   
Mom’s little image blinked in the chatbox. And then the words popped up. “Hello Thelma. It’s me, Mom”.   
   
Fear gripped my throat. I knew it must be some hacking thing or stupid error but I was paralysed. I turned round and glanced at my bedroom door- it was closed, although the sounds of TV from the living room still came wafting in. Aunt Claudia had the TV on whenever she was downstairs, even if she was not watching it.   
   
“Don’t be scared Thelma. It’s really me. I found a way a talk to you, my darling precious child. I’ve been missing you so much.”   
   
If this was a hacker’s joke, it was the cruellest joke in the world. Against my will, tears began welling in my eyes, spilling out.   
   
“Oh my darling, please don’t cry. It’s ok. And it’s no use crying anyway. I need you to save that energy”   
   
My fingers still stiff from fear, I managed to type out a response. “Mom? What do you mean? Is that u rlly?”   
   
I could sense her familiar frustration rushing back through the laptop– same as when she felt I wasn’t being smart or strong enough, when she was alive. “Of course Thelma, it’s me. And I’ve come back to tell you something important.”   
   
I had my own important news to share. “Did you know Aunt Claudia moved in last weekend?”   
   
“Yes, Thelma. I know. And this is what gave me the strength to come and tell you. Please be strong. I know you are a strong girl, and you can deal with this- I am sorry you have to. But you have to know. I have to tell you. She can’t have everything- my life, man, house, child”   
   
A different kind of fear took over me. “Mom what do u mean?”   
   
“Thelma, I’m sorry to put this on you like this. I don’t know what else to do. You have to know. Aunt Claudia murdered me”   
   
The bottom of my world gave way as I dropped into a dark hole of dread and fear. I felt as if I had known this all along, all through the past four months, ever since that awful night when Aunt Claudia called from the hospital, where she worked, to talk to Dad. I just couldn’t say it.   
   
“Thelma? Are you listening to me?”   
   
If I had any doubts that the laptop chat was really my Mom, those words dispelled them- I heard them in the exact voice she always used to say those very words to me.   
   
“Yes Mom. But how?”   
   
“She was at the hospital you know. When I went in. She wasn’t on my floor, but it was very easy for her to arrange for me to pick up an infection”   
   
“Thelma?” The door opened and Aunt Claudia poked her head in. I gave a little scream and frantically minimized the chatbox. Aunt Claudia stepped forward. “Oh honey you look like you’ve seen a ghost. Are you ok?”   
   
Wordlessly I nodded. Aunt Claudia sighed. “Thelma sweetheart, I miss your Mom too, but this moping isn’t doing you any good, it’s hurting your dad, you know. Do you want him to suffer more?”   
   
I shrugged. I couldn’t speak. I looked up at her. The light was odd on her face, she looked more like Mom than ever before, but also not.   
   
“And these clothes, Thelma!” She reached out and touched my black sleeve, and I flinched back as though she had hit me. She frowned and for an instant I thought she was actually going to slap me. But then she smiled and said “I know girls your age like to wear black all over but what do you say me and you have a trip to the mall and pick you up some nice new gear? On me. C’mon sweetheart, it will be so much fun!”   
   
I shook my head furiously. Tears of rage, grief, and fear splatter out. Aunt Claudia began again “Oh Thelma-” but then she stopped and went quiet. I looked up at her face. She was pale and had a horrible expression, she was staring at my laptop.   
   
I followed her line of sight, turning around to look at my screen.   
   
The photo had changed. There was a new photo in background, showing Mom seemingly asleep in a hospital bed, and Aunt Claudia by her side, bent over her.   
   
Aunt Claudia seemed to jolt into life. Her face twisted into a terrible snarl she screamed “Are you playing tricks on me?” and she lunged towards me. I cringed back in my chair, raising my hands to defend myself against her onslaught.   
   
But before she could even touch me, a bolt of electricity sprang out of the laptop, hit her square in the chest and she dropped dead to the floor.   
   
I shrieked in terror.   
   
\*\*\*   
   
Dad and I had to move from that town- losing two wives in four months isn’t a good look for anyone. Even though the police combed through our statements and the laptop and the electricity up and down- they eventually had to put it down to a freak accident which happened when I asked my aunt for help to get my laptop working.   
   
Dad never remarried, and I never heard from Mom again.

Title: My Name is Allison and I'm a Snuff Film Star

No, I don’t have the source for the movies and before you ask, it's not mainstream porn you can find by just googling my name. They’re videos of me being murdered. Where would you even find those types of videos? The dark web, maybe? I don’t know. I don’t like watching myself being murdered. 

What I can tell you is, I’ve starred in over 50 movies and according to the guy who distributes them I’m the most watched and most sought-after snuff star in history, If that's even a thing.

You’re probably wondering how one would even get into that business. Well, the short answer is by accident. You don’t wake up one day and decide you want to be murdered. 

In my case, I answered an ad looking for an amateur porn actress. I was just starting out in the business and the pay seemed reasonable. When I arrived at the location which was a house in an upmarket location, it didn’t raise any red flags. It all seemed legit until I asked to be paid upfront, and the response was, let's see how you die first. Before I knew it, I was being held down and the cameras began rolling. 

All I can say is dying is like going to sleep during surgery. It's painful at the start and scary, but when your heart starts slowing down you get a rush of euphoria and everything goes silent before the lights go out.  

I couldn’t tell if there was an afterlife. I don’t stay dead long enough to find out. It's like going to sleep without dreaming, there’s a nanosecond of darkness before you wake up again. 

You would think that a guy whose business is death would be easily scared, but when I suddenly woke up as they were loading me into a shallow grave in the woods he screamed like a little girl. 

It took some time to calm him down. You would swear it was him that was just brutally murdered with the way he reacted, but once the initial shock wore off he looked me dead in the eye (no pun intended) and said, I’m going to make you a fucking star. 

I can’t go into details on how I get snuffed out, but I can say, the money is great. More than I could ever make being in mainstream porn. 

The problem isn’t the fact that my employer is a death dealer of women. Actually, no women have been murdered apart from me of course, since I started. The problem is the reaction I'm starting to get the more my popularity grows.

The surprising thing is, the people who notice me are the most ordinary people you could imagine. Not monsters that hide away in the shadows fantasizing about murdering women. I mean school teachers, doctors, and even young teenagers.

The biggest shock for me was when I was sitting in a cafe and I was approached by a young dad who had his two young daughters with him. He sat staring at me while his daughters sat eating chocolate muffins. I knew why he was looking at me, even if he didn’t. As I was finishing up my latte I looked up to see him standing next to me with a strange grin on his face. 

“Do I know you from somewhere?” He suddenly asked. 

I was in my comfort clothes, a baggy t-shirt with a pair of sweatpants and the tattoo of a pentagram on my arm was on show. He began studying me to figure out how he knew me and when I was just about to speak, he noticed the tattoo on my arm. It was like a light switched on in his brain and he suddenly realized where he knew me from. His face turned deathly pale and he began to stutter a bit before he hurried himself and his daughters out of the cafe. 

I was never really worried about being noticed before, because the men that watched me expected me to be dead. I also never gave a second thought to my tattoo being the thing that gave me away. I mean how many girls out there have the same tattoo? When I got it done I was told it was a popular choice. That all changed when I got a phone call from my mother. 

My poor mother had no clue about the type of business I was in. She always thought I was into some lifestyle stuff, like a trainer to the stars or something. I think the dream was better than the reality and she always told her friends I was a successful businesswoman of some sort. Technically, she wasn’t wrong. 

All that changed when she rang me in hysterics. She could barely contain herself over the phone. “You’re alive, you’re alive, is all she kept on repeating down the phone. After I calmed her down and reassured her I was very much alive I waited until her breathing had slowed to a more relaxed state. 

“Alison, for a moment I thought I was speaking to a ghost.” My mother was always my biggest fan in life and it broke my heart to hear her this upset. 

“The police were here. Men in suits, detectives I think. They told me you were dead. Oh my sweet girl they told me you were dead. They had found blood and something about a tape or the internet. The bastards gave me a heart attack. I knew you weren’t dead.”

That night, I went to stay with my mother. Just to reassure her that I was still physically present and to just hug her. Mainly to reassure myself that I was definitely still present in this world. Deep down, I knew what this was about. Of course, someone who wasn’t a degenerate monster was going to watch my movies and try to put a name on the woman who should be somewhere in a shallow grave. But I always thought people would think the movies were just great fakes because you can only be the star of one snuff movie, not fifty. 

A few weeks had passed and apart from my mother losing a year or two of her life things had settled down.

 I had decided to quit, it was never going to be a long-term thing, but if I was going to stop, my final movie was going to be my best. Go out with a bang I always say. 

It was the day of the shoot and on the way to the location, I couldn’t escape the feeling I was being watched. I put it down to my nerves because I was going to die in the most brutal way possible. It was going to be so bad no one was ever going to think it was faked. And the fact it was going to be the last video of me, made it sound all the more believable. 

I knew it was going to be painful, but the pain never lasted and all I was thinking was, it's going to be a spectacular death and it was. But as the euphoria swept over me and I began to slip into the darkness, I watched as men in swat gear burst into the room followed by men in suits. 

As always, I came back to life with a big gasp of air, like a baby taking its first breath after being expelled from the womb. I was expecting to be in the room where I was murdered, but this time I found myself on a cold metal slab. As I looked around what looked like an operating room I saw two men in suits. One was smiling, while the other appeared to hand over money from his wallet. 

“Hi, welcome back. I just bet my colleague fifty dollars that you would come back from the dead,” he said as he put the note into his top pocket.

 “I must say, I am a big fan of your movies. Damsel in the Dungeon is my personal favourite,” said the smartly dressed man as he smiled down at me. 

This was the first time I had ever felt in danger. A sudden panic washed over me as I tried to get up off the table. 

The two men in suits smiled at each other before handing me a hospital gown. 

“Where am I,” I asked nervously. 

“You have nothing to worry about, it's not like we are going to kill you,” said one of the men as they burst out laughing. 

The two men walked me to an interview room and sat me down at a table opposite them. 

“You still haven’t told me who you are and my reasons for being here.” 

The two men adjusted themselves into a more serious posture. 

“Sorry for the confusion. My name is Agent Harris and my colleague here is Agent Butler.”

“I look across at the two young agents sitting across from me as their frozen expressions fixate on me.”

“Agents? Are you F.B.I. or something,” I nervously asked.

One of the agents gave a disgruntled laugh as if I offended him. 

“Close, we’re with the CIA.” 

“What do you want with me? I didn’t know dying was illegal.”

The two men sat upright as one of them put a picture of a woman in front of me.

“We need your help with a delicate situation. It’s of the utmost importance to the security of this country.”

I looked down at the picture of a woman who looked strangely enough like me. Apart from her expensive-looking attire and different-coloured hair, we had the same facial features and we looked to be the same height. 

“The woman in the picture is the wife of the Russian minister for defense Sergei Shoigu,” said the Agent with a sound of urgency in his voice. 

“What does this have to do with me?” I asked. 

“She has a lot of secrets that could be very important to us. The problem is her husband isn’t a nice man. Fortunately for us, he treats her like a dog. So she wants a way out of the marriage, but being the man he is, he’s not going to let her go so easily.” 

“I still don’t get what this has to do with me.”

The two agents look at each other before fixating their stares at me again. 

“Sergei is a very powerful man. Even if we got her out of the country we couldn’t guarantee her safety. The only way we could do that is if we faked her death, but it has to look convincing and that is where you come in.”

It suddenly began to make sense. I remember a guy friend of mine who was big into conspiracy theories and would always bang on about how the moon landings were faked in a studio. 

“So would I be correct in thinking you want me to make another movie, given my special talent?” 

The two agents look at each other again, but this time with a smile.

“She catches on quick. I’m beginning to like her already.”

I picked up the picture again and stared at the woman looking back at me with pain in her eyes and a painted-on smile. 

“How much does this gig pay?”

Title: I found a store that sells the shoes of dead people and bought three pairs.
Author: u/sugarfruit33

“Soles,” read the sign that hung above the small store; “Walk In Their Shoes” written below it. The motto caught my eye on my way home from work, and the color-faded sneakers on my feet were ogling it too.

A little bell rang as I opened the door, the inside smelling like leather. There were rows of shelves with dozens of pairs of shoes, all different kinds. An old man sitting behind the register perked his head up as he saw me.

“Hello. How can I help you?”

“Uh, just browsing.”

“Alright, let me know if you need anything.”

I skimmed down the aisles as I scanned the shoes with my gaze. There were sneakers, boots, high heels; anything you could think of. Almost all of them seemed old or worn.

The first pair I pulled off the shelves were loafers, something nice that I wear to work or fancy events. Its black leather was creased but intact, and the metal buckle still shined.

As I continued down the aisles, the next pair of shoes I found were white air force ones with only a moderate amount of stains. With enough scrubbing, I could make them look brand new. So I took them as well.

And finally, I came across a scuffed pair of dark brown boots. They looked good for winter time so I tucked them between my arms along with the other two pairs.

On a tight budget, I figured that was enough. I dumped the pairs onto the counter as the old man looked up.

“Is this all?”

I nodded. He typed on a cash register, his eyes darting to each pair as the keys clicked. I handed him crumbled bills as he put the shoes in brown boxes.

“Have a nice day, and enjoy their shoes.”

“… Thank you.”

I furrowed my brows as I turned away, his wording confusing me. THEIR shoes. It was an odd thing to say, and it stuck to the back of my mind on the way home. As I stepped inside, I set the boxes down and unpacked them.

It wasn’t a traditional shoe store, so I had to hope they’d all fit right. I decide to unpack the loafers first, knowing I’d be wearing those the most. Sitting on my bed, I slipped the first one onto my foot.

I wiggled my toes around as I felt the fit of the shoe. It fit perfectly, but with one of my feet being slightly bigger than the other, I decided to try the other one on just to make sure. As I slipped it on, I felt this drowsiness cloud over me. 

My eyelids sank as my vision blurred, nausea brewing in my stomach. Suddenly, the softness of my bed beneath me grew hard, the temperature around me dropping to a chill. As my vision cleared, I looked around and realized I wasn’t in my bedroom anymore.

I was in a hospital room, the beeping of a heart rate monitor filling the silent room. I looked down at myself as I was wearing clothes I didn’t recognize, but I still had on the black loafers. Then, I realized there was a shaking hand wrapped around mine.

A dying woman laid in the bed; she was old, losing hair, and visibly tired. I didn’t recognize her, yet I felt like I knew exactly who she was. I felt like she raised me, and now she was dying right before my eyes. 

I wiped away a tear as the preparation for grief became overwhelming. She smiled at me weakly with fading eyes.

“I can’t do this without you… I can’t be here with you,” I sobbed.

I spoke with no control, but I didn’t feel like I was lacking control either.

“Yes you can… I’ve prepared you for it all of your life.”

I leaned in as she kissed my forehead softly, gently wiping away a tear.

“Take good care of Gigi for me, would you?”

I nodded with a smile as tears continued to stream. Somehow that name was familiar too, more than familiar. That was my sister, her face popping into my head. Another person I didn’t recognize yet did at the same time.

In the moment, it felt impossible to question what was going on, as if it was normal. As I sat back down, I watched life disappear from her as her heart rate flattened. I collapsed into tears, the drops soaking into my pants.

The pain was something I had never felt before, it was consuming. Everything felt like it was over, like it was crashing down. Suddenly, I turned to a cracked window that let in a cold, gentle breeze. 

My face continued to crumble as I rushed towards it. Prying it open, the wind began brushing my hair back as I lifted my foot onto the windowsill. As I balanced on it, I held onto the edges of the window as I looked down.

Vertigo hit me like a train as nausea brewed in my stomach. The distance from the window to the ground was terrifying, but enough. I turned to my mother one last time, her corpse lying peacefully on the bed.

“I’m sorry…”

I propelled myself from the windowsill and out into the open air. I squeezed my eyes tight as I freefell, the powerful wind deafening as I pressed against me. As I continued to fall, awaiting the end, I opened my eyes.

And as I did, watching the pavement below me quickly grow closer, all I could think about was how much I didn’t want to die. But it was too late, as I was now closer to the ground than I was to the safety of the windowsill beneath my feet.

I clenched my eyes again as I reached the ground, experiencing a near split second of a gnarly crunching sound in my ears as everything blinked to blackness. Suddenly, I found myself in my bedroom again, my feet safely on the wooden floorboards.

My body trembled as my eyes darted around. I tried to tell myself I had just fallen asleep, but it was all too real. I felt all of it. After quickly kicking the shoes off, I stuffed them back in the box and crammed them in my closet.

But as terrifying as it was, something about it intrigued me deeply. To be able to literally walk in the shoes of somebody else, it’s something you can never truly comprehend. Especially someone else’s final moments.

So I decided that, after taking a break from the first experience, I would try the next pair of shoes tomorrow and see if they would have the same effect. I struggled to fall asleep that night; thinking about the body that I inhabited. To think that he would’ve done anything to have gone back but couldn’t… It unsettled me, to say the least. 

The next morning, I decided that I wouldn’t be taking my worn down running shoes on my morning run. Instead, I pulled out the box that contained the sneakers. Dropping them by my feet, I took a deep breath before slipping my first foot inside.

Then, I prepared for the heaviness to drape onto me as I put on the second shoe. But, to my surprise, nothing happened. I sat and waited for a moment, the untied shoes on my feet. And it still didn’t happen. I thought maybe I had just struck lucky with one pair that happened to be owned by a dead person.

I trotted down my apartment steps and stepped outside. The sun beamed down on me as I queued up a song on my phone and slipped in my earbuds. Then, as I planted my feet onto the ground and began to run, the haze clouded me.

Just like last time, my vision blurred. But I could still feel my legs moving, one foot in front of the other. As my music drowned out into white noise, and eventually silence, I felt my evermoving feet plant onto the floor again.

My lungs and heart blazed with exhaustion as I found myself flying down what appeared to be a school hallway. I didn’t know why I was running, but I knew that pure and utter fear coursed through my veins and fueled my legs.

Then, as I ran, a smeared trail of blood paralleled to me. As I ran down it, my body trembled as it led to the body of a young girl lying in a pool of blood. Bullet holes riddled her body and her backpack.

Then, that’s when the deafening sound of rapid gunfire went off, and I remembered why I was running. I managed to run even faster as blood curdling screams echoed throughout the empty halls; backpacks and binders dumped across the floors.

I needed somewhere to hide, so I began pounding on the first door next to me. I tugged on its locked handle as I pleaded for help.

“I’M A STUDENT! I SWEAR! PLEASE LET ME IN! I DON’T WANNA DIE!”

The door quickly cracked open as someone yanked me inside a dark room. A teacher closed the door behind us and locked it again, prompting me to sit in the corner with everyone else as she shushed us.

I dropped to the floor and squeezed in with everyone, the silent room filled with the sounds of restrained sobs and shaking breaths. Fellow students next to me had their phones out, their trembling fingers quickly typing out their goodbyes.

Knowing there was a chance this was it, I pulled out my phone and quickly began texting my parents.

“Shooting at school. I love you.”

Unable to handle their responses, I slid my phone back into my pocket as I prayed. Then, all of our bodies winced as the sound of muffled gunfire boomed from outside. Students clamped their mouths shut as they bottled up screams in their throats.

Suddenly, the room erupted in terror as bullets began to tear through the wooden door. Everyone in the room scattered as those who couldn’t move fast enough slumped against the blood splattered wall.

Cramped in another corner, everyone quietly sobbed as light from the hallway poured through the bullet holes. Then, the crowd screamed as the shooter began kicking in the door. With each pound, our bodies jolted.

Suddenly, my phone vibrated in my pocket. I told myself I couldn’t handle what my parents would say, but if I was going to die, I needed to know. So I quickly pulled my phone out and shakily opened the message.

“Are you okay?? I love you so much baby.”

Then, as I looked up, the shooter had the door down and was in the room. With a burst of fire, he had the teacher down in seconds. The students cried in horror as he then turned to us with his gun raised. 

My ears rang as he sprayed us with bullets, blood splashing around. The shock was so numbing, but I knew I was shot. Within seconds, everything went to black, and I found my feet back on the pavement of my street.

I gagged as puke flooded up my throat, then puked onto the sidewalk. My heart was still pounding; it was all too real. Too shaken up to continue, I ran back home and ripped the shoes off my feet.

After that, I had no desire to try on the final pair that I bought. Curiosity had killed the cat, I couldn’t do it again. So I shoved the shoes into the back of my closet and never touched them again.

As months passed, I nearly forgot I had even owned them. Out of sight, out of mind. During this time, I had moved out of my apartment and into a house with my girlfriend at the time.

Packing was chaotic, and it wasn’t all done by me, so somehow the shoe boxes got caught up in all of the mess. With a lot of time spent at work, my girlfriend would do a lot of the unpacking while I was gone.

Keep in mind, I had never mentioned the shoes to her. I felt like she’d look at me like I was insane, and I wouldn’t blame her for thinking so. The experience itself was insane.

So to her, she was just putting her boyfriend's shoes in his closet. One day, on a winter morning, I had overslept for work. Rushing to get ready, I snatched a pair of boots that I didn’t have time to give a double-take.

I crammed my feet into them as I flew out the door, my grip tight on my car keys. As I muttered curses to myself under my breath, I got in the car. And as I closed the car door, it began to happen again.

The sounds of the busy street distanced to silence as my vision blurred. As it cleared up, I found myself in the driver's seat of a car. When I looked around, I found myself in dark woods, parked on a trail. 

Then, I heard the muffled sound of screaming as someone wriggled around in the trunk. Unlike my feelings the other two times, this one was different. Upon hearing the screams, they went in one ear and out the other. I didn’t feel… anything.

I stepped out of the car, the humid air heavy against my skin. Closing the door with a gloved hand, I slowly walked towards the trunk of the car as dirt crunched under my boots.

Opening the trunk revealed a petrified woman whose arms and legs were bound by rope. She desperately wiggled around as she screamed into a strip of cloth that wrapped around her mouth.

“NO, NO!” She attempted to cry as I gripped her by the hair and ripped her from out the trunk.

She crashed to the ground, tears streaming down her face. Bunching her hair up in my grip, she continued to attempt her escape as I dragged her down a dirt path. She groaned as I dropped her head to the ground, standing in front of a human sized hole that I had dug.

Suddenly, she had maneuvered the cloth off of her mouth and began screeching.

“HELP! HELP!”

“No point in that, darlin’.”

“NO! STOP! PLEASE!”

She desperately begged as I kicked her onto her back and crouched above her, her cries echoing throughout the vast forest. I remained unphased as she tried to knee my back.

“Shut… your FUCKING MOUTH!”

Her teary eyes widened as I wrapped my hands around her throat, the leather of my gloves stretching. Her wriggling grew vigorous as I tightened my grip, breaths desperately trying to make their way into her lungs.

I clenched my teeth as I made my grip even tighter, her face turning red as she failed to fight back. She refused to look at me, her eyes darting around the midnight sky. I pursed my lips, watching as life slowly faded from her eyes.

I shook her neck in my grip as her attempted breaths wheezed to a stop, her widened eyes emptying. Suddenly, I whipped my head around as the sound of a snapping twig caught my ear. In the dark stood a silhouette, one that I didn’t have time to make out as a loud bang rang out.

My eyes shot open as I felt my mouth filling up with blood. My grip around her throat quickly loosened as I collapsed next to her. Blood spurted from the hole in my throat as I coughed up what pooled in my mouth. 

I stared up at the star filled sky as a police officer ran over, his gun still raised. He dropped next to her and checked her pulse, then spoke over his radio. Quickly bleeding out, everything soon faded to black.

I then found myself back in my car, my grip tight on the steering wheel. I quickly pulled my trembling hands away as a tear streamed down my cheek. I hesitantly looked down at the boots on my feet, realizing what I was wearing.

Instead of going to work, I ran back inside and grabbed the other two pairs. Flying down the streets, I halted to a stop in front of the shoe store and carried the boxes inside.

“Making a return?” The old man said as he heard the bell on the door.

“Uh- Yeah.”

“The usual…”

I placed the boxes onto the counter, my body still trembling. He tallied up the prices as he looked at each pair.

“So? How was it?”

“What?”

“What was it like? Walking in their shoes?”

“… Unpleasant.”

“Well… Imagine how they felt. Actually, you already did! Have a nice day.”

He smiled ominously as he handed me crumpled up bills. With a hesitant hand, I quickly snatched the cash and flew out the door. Getting back in my car, I let out a deep, exhausted sigh.

The next day, on my way to work, I passed the store again. Except, it was vacant. A streaky outline of the logo was left on its bricks, the space appearing entirely empty through its dusty windows. I furrowed my brows as I slowly drove by, trying to see if a note was left about a relocation or a retirement.

But there was nothing, it was just gone. I never found out who that man was or where he went. I never found out how he got all those shoes, I don’t think I had ever even seen somebody else in the store. 

I had pondered on the idea that maybe it appeared just for me. It sounded crazy, but so did seeing visions of dead people. I couldn’t figure out if I was supposed to be taught a lesson, but I knew it was one I could’ve lived without learning.

&#x200B;

My hands tremble over the keyboard and I may have a concussion so please forgive any typos or brevity of my update. It is the morning after my typically amenable and kindhearted girlfriend’s body was possessed in sleep by some malicious entity. I’ve been distant this morning, so she knows something is amiss… but obviously still reeling from the experience… I can’t tell her yet that she tried to rip out my throat and shit down my neck. You understand.

I’m tired. Obviously I didn’t sleep last night, but I did stay up most of the night with all of the lights on feverishly clutching my water bottle in the living room. The demonic beast inside my GF managed to creep its way back into control sometime soon after I exited the room and pinned it closed with a dining room chair. Given her eye movements and the activation delay, my theory is that the beast is allowed control during REM .. but what do I know? It spent most of the evening attempting to coax me back into the bedroom, this time with a pinch more emotional intelligence, calling out to me in what was as close to my GF’s normal voice as it could manage.

“Come to bed sweetie, why are you sleeping on the couch again? “

I decide I’m not going to validate this demon with a response. But moments later, the too-deep sinister voice is back: “*If you don’t open this door I will slit the cats throat*”.

*FUCK*. I forgot about the cat. He’s still in the bedroom, probably cowering in fear, hissing in the corner to no avail. My guess is that the cat is already dead, but what can I do? Let our beloved kitty be eaten alive by someone he trusts? I’ve seen enough horror movies to know that this is the moment I have to decide to do something dumb and heroic, or die on-screen while everyone yells about how much of an idiot I am for opening the door.  I may have a little more sympathy for these characters now, people thrust into impossible situations are forced to make impossible choices.

Against my better judgement, I’m going to open the door, get the cat out of the room. I’m staring at the bedroom door now and notice something damp and muscly poking and prodding its way out from under the door. I point my phone’s flashlight at it and realize it is my girlfriends tongue. I catch myself experiencing an intrusive thought, wondering if she will want to know why her mouth is full of cat hair tomorrow …

But this is perfect. I need to test out my new technique: a spray bottle full of sink water. I spray the tongue as it inch-worms itself around the edge of the door, presumably looking for purchase on my human flesh. It immediately recoils, and I hear the body inside collapse. Water is still a demon-possession off switch, I decide, and immediately tear the chair away from holding the door locked. I don’t even have time to think about whether I have holy water on tap, I need to act fast. Attempting to open the door now, my SO’s unconscious body is blocking me from entering. It requires quite a bit of force to slide her ragdoll body behind the door so I can squeeze through. Trying not to look too closely at her, I realize now that she is sweating a black oily substance and the bed and floor are totally drenched. I realize the reason it was so difficult to open the door, the demon-sweat is sticky. She may be stuck to the ground? Carefully avoiding stepping in the demon super-glue I’m now inside the bedroom. To my dismay I don’t see the cat right away. It makes sense, frightened as hell it must have crawled and hid under the bed. Yikes. I’ve got to persuade it out from under there now, but that will mean I need to get down on my belly and reach under the bed.

Realizing the absurdity of my situation I have one hand pointing a spray bottle at my dead-asleep girlfriend and one hand reaching under the bed to grab my cat. My eyes trained on my GF I reach blindly under the dark bed. I can feel its soft fur. I wrap my hand around it and attempt to bring it towards me. It wriggles free from my grasp with evidently zero intention of making this easy. It crawls deeper under the bed. Frustrated, I take my eyes off my girlfriend to look where it went. No sign of it, I make the call to put the spray bottle down and point my phone flashlight under the bed. It’s too deep underneath for me to get it from this side.

I’m going to need to go around to the other side to capture it. Pulling my head back out from underneath the bed I realize my fatal error: my girlfriend has woken up. She is standing over me, a dark tower as I lay vulnerable on the ground beside the bed. Her teeth look sharper from this angle in my phone’s flashlight (why didn’t I turn on the bedroom light?), she is drooling that black oily glue… her hair, normally a gorgeous brown, is so glossed with black paste that it has slicked itself to her head like she just got out of the shower. Her eyes are menacing, wide open, bloodshot and yellow? She looks tired. I’m tired too… but it’s time to go. The cat heroics can wait.

Just as I’m about to scuttle an adrenaline-filled crawl around her legs and out the open door she grabs both ankles with both of her arms. I remember her typically gentle touch is nowhere to be found in this grip as her nails dig shallow wounds into my legs. With inhuman strength she begins raising my entire body weight by my legs, plainly in an attempt to start eating me alive from the toes up. Little does she know, I’ve never skipped a leg day in my life. I kicked my girlfriend square in her teeth with both feet. She drops me on my head but I can’t feel it. While she is stunned I manage to get to my feet, carefully avoid the preternatural spiderweb paste, and exit the room. Hands shaking I adjust the chair to the correct angle just in time to hear agitated knocking on the other side.

“Baby come back to bed, it’s late, you’re going to be so tired at work tomorrow”

All of that and I didn’t even get the damn cat out? And my spray bottle is still in there. What the hell am I going to do now?

Title: My brother's imaginary friend.
Author: u/shygirlturnedsassy

I was 10-11 years old when this started, my brother was 4-5. Like most kids, Kyle too had an imaginary friend. And like most kids with imaginary friends, Kyle had given his a name with distinctive physical features. If I remember correctly, the friend’s name was Bosco. Bosco was short, pudgy and had a grey beard. My parents thought it was a bit strange that Kyle’s imaginary friend would be an adult man, but they didn’t dwell on it too much. 

Bosco quickly became a part of our daily routine. While getting ready for school, Kyle would insist that I needed to stop hogging the mirror as Bosco had to fix his hair and beard, at breakfast (and lunch and dinner) the chair next to Kyle was to be left unoccupied because that’s where Bosco would sit. My parents were just grateful that he didn’t ask for an extra platter to be prepared, as Bosco did not eat. He just wanted to sit there to keep Kyle company. 

Bosco would make his presence felt at school too. Kyle’s teacher once called my mom how impressed she was with Kyle’s quickly expanding vocabulary. He was learning new words and when asked, he would say his friend Bosco had said them to him. I remember this one instance when a new family moved into our neighborhood. Their kid was Kyle’s age. Mom took us over to say “hello” to them. I remember Kyle shook the other kid’s hand and said rather clearly, “I’m very pleased to make your acquaintance.” The other kid just stared. My mom struggled not to look smug!

My dad wasn’t all that interested in Kyle’s friend, or in anything else his kids did for that matter. So it was mostly my mom and I who got to hear about how nice and “fantabulous” Bosco was. 

Then came the incident that made us rethink just how *imaginary* Bosco really was. One day, Kyle and I were waiting at the bus stop just outside of school for mom to pick us up. This place always had a lot of parents and kids around so it was safe. Suddenly, Kyle began pulling on my arm, telling me he wanted to go to the store across the street and get a candy bar. I told him we could get one when mom got there, but he just wouldn’t listen. He pulled on my arm almost frantically and kept saying he NEEDED a candy bar NOW! I gave in, and walked with him to the store all the while telling him if mom got mad at us, it would be his fault. The moment we had crossed the street, the driver of a bus lost control of the vehicle and mowed down a bunch of people at the bus stop. 

It was like a scene from a movie. I was in a state of shock while Kyle started crying. When my mom got there, she hugged us for what seemed like an eternity. She knew we could have been among the people who were crushed. Once we had gotten home and had calmed down, she asked me why we had crossed the street. I told her about Kyle wanting a candy bar. She questioned Kyle who told her he didn’t really want a candy bar. Bosco did. And he’s the one who told Kyle to get me to go to the store with him. My mom turned pale. 

For some time after that, life went on as usual. Mom now asked Kyle about Bosco quite regularly. But he didn’t say anything out of the ordinary, just regular kids’ stuff. But another surprise for us was right around the corner.

My mom’s sister, our aunt Rita, had just moved to our town. She had landed a job at the same company where dad worked.  And I remember that she and my dad got along very well. 

One weekend, my mom took us to see our maternal grandparents. Dad said he couldn’t come as he had work. Mom seemed disappointed but agreed to take us without him. Nanna and Poppa too were impressed at how articulate Kyle was becoming. And listened with great interest about his new friend Bosco. 

The next afternoon, we were all sitting in the living room. I was playing with my grandparents’ dog, mom and her parents were talking while Kyle was fiddling with the TV remote. He switched to a channel where the movie Ghost was playing. The famous “pottery scene” (you know which one) was on. Mom instantly grabbed the remote and changed the channel to Cartoon Network. 

Kyle was upset. He demanded to know why he couldn’t watch the movie. Mom explained  to him that he could watch it when he was older and that it wasn’t appropriate for kids to watch grown ups “hug each other” like that. Kyle argued some more and mom agin told him he wasn’t old enough. He  pouted and in sheer exasperation  asked why it was OK for dad and aunt Rita to hug like that in his bed. 

Mom was taken aback and asked what he was talking about. Kyle told her that dad and aunt Rita would get naked and “hug” in his bed, “just like in the movie” when we were at school and mom was at work. Once or twice a week, dad would come home for a while and he and aunt Rita would hug in Kyle’s bed. And then get dressed and leave. 

Mom was outraged and asked why he was making up such a disgusting story. Kyle insisted that he didn’t make it up. Bosco had told him. Bosco also said that aunt Rita was *hugging* dad right then even as they spoke. Mom’s gaze turned cold. She told our grandparents she was going home. She drove back to our house in a hurry. I deduced that aunt Rita really was there because mom came back later that night with more of our stuff and said that we’d be staying with nanna and poppa for a while. 

My parents were divorced by the end of that year.

Title: I was at the Miami mall, this was not a hoax.

(*This is a fictional story for entertainment purposes*)

I was at the Bayside marketplace on new years day. To those who don't know, something unexplainable happened that night. Something that the authorities covered up and put off as teens starting a riot. While I wish that were the case, it's far from the truth. I don't know if putting this out there is the best idea, but I can't hold my tongue any longer. You see, I'm a construction worker in the Miami area. While I don't have any children of my own; I have a little sister who means the world to me. She's an honor student with straight A's who's about to go off to university.

While I spent my youth staying in trouble, she studied hard. And before she leaves, I wanted to do something nice for her. That evening when I got off of work, I planned to go to the mall and buy her a nice handbag. Little did I know, something happened there that changed my entire life. As I pulled into the parking lot, the moon shined bright in the sky. Cars were parked as far as the eye could see, though this was nothing new. As places like this constantly stayed packed. I walked in still wearing my dirty uniform with my name tag printed on the chest.

People filled the floor, shopping and celebrating the new year with friends. I wasn't much of a shopper, so I planned to grab the bag and go. I walked into the store and saw the many purses they had in stock. Some wore price tags that climbed into the tens of thousands. While I did admire my genius little sis, I didn't love her that much. I could feel the eyes on me as I looked around; this place was usually for a higher class of people. But regardless, I found one that was within a reasonable price range. It was white and had one of those famous designer's names embroidered onto it. It seemed perfect for a nice looking young girl like her. 

I grabbed it and walked over to the register to pay. The preppy woman had a look in her eye like she was afraid to touch me. But it didn't matter, I was proud of my sister and she deserved to be rewarded. After she bagged the purse up, I was ready to leave. But that's when it happened…I saw people running in droves. Their faces filled with terror and shock; not looking back no matter what. I walked into the confusion to see what was going on. That's when I saw them, strange shadow-like creatures walking through the mall. There were about five of them; and they all had to be at least twelve feet tall. All slinking around like creatures from a sci-fi film.

With a fight or flight response, I turned to join the crowd in running. Dropping my sister's purse like it was yesterday's trash. But as I began running, one of those creatures towered above me. I stood frozen in terror, the entity looked down on me with purple orb like eyes. Before I knew it, I began to float up into the air. The strange being lifted me high enough to match eyes with it. The smog-like substance it seemed to be made of began flooding my mouth and nose. I thought I was a goner; but oddly enough I could still breathe. In my head however, my mind began playing my thoughts like a movie. From my childhood all the way to my adult years. All the good, the bad, I relived it all in a single moment.

At first I thought it was my life flashing before my eyes. But I soon realized that this being was watching with me. Learning everything it could, even going through my darkest and most vulnerable thoughts. After what seemed like forever, I was placed safely back on the ground. I then stood in shock as the smoky creature slinked away and disappeared. Joining the other creatures that had invaded the sprawling shopping center. Once it was over, I sprinted out of the mall. Honestly feeling violated and terrified by this whole experience. Outside cop cars lined the streets in an unbelievable turn out. There was no doubt in my mind they had to be preparing for war. In an attempt to protect and drive these horrible invaders away. 

But sadly, I would be sorely mistaken. As time passed I began to hear them talking about a riot being started. That a bunch of teenagers were throwing fireworks and fighting. I was naturally confused, there were never any rowdy kids. There weren't any fireworks either, just ungodly beings not from this world. Why were they trying to hide it? I would attempt to talk to several officer's; but they didn't want to hear it. They all blew me off and looked at me like I was insane.

After a few days passed, things only got worse. The media had completely blamed this on teenagers. With everyone making jokes about what really happened. I even heard of people's phones being confiscated before videos could be posted. Meanwhile I had to start going to therapy, as the nightmares I had became unbearable. In my dreams, I would be wandering aimlessly through a baron and cold world. It was filled with the same gigantic smoke-like beings. I watched them creep around, feeling like I was trapped. Every morning I would wake up in a cold sweat; terrified but thankful that I was at home.

I told my therapist about this, but he tried searching for a more logical explanation. Saying that maybe I fell and hit my head during all the confusion. But that's not what happened…I will never forget what I saw that day. The media and everyone can believe what they want, but I know what I saw. I've never believed in stuff like this, but it was real. And I fear everyday that I might run into one of those things again. Not just that, but I shudder every time I recall that entity invading my mind. If anyone out there isn't afraid, share your story…they can't hide the truth forever.

TW: 16f, true story once again. In 9th grade I was a pretty bad kid, always smoking or drinking or sneaking out. Well I ended up meeting a ~senior~ boy who asked me to go on a date with him. I was super excited because I had never really gone on an actual date since all of them were just me sneaking off to their house to drink or parties with lots of other people. I told my parents and they were fine with it as long as they met him first. I got all dolled up and he showed up at my door. He was really awkward when he met my parents which was fine, but it gave me a really weird feeling in my stomach. I went into his car and asked where we were gonna go, he started driving around and ended up pulling into behind our high school and parked. I was kind of disappointed since I thought we would actually be going out somewhere, but that was the least of my issues. He turned the car off which immediately made me uneasy, everything in my brain was telling me to go home right now, but I was far away and I didn’t really have an excuse to ask my mom to come get me since nothing had happened yet. He asked me to go in the backseat with him and I said no, he started asking over and over and while I continued saying no began screaming at me to get in the back, I tried to get out of the car but my door wouldn’t open. He grabbed my arm really hard and forced me to look at him, he told me if I didn’t get in the back he was going to hurt me. I told him to let go and that he was already hurting me and he said he could make it a lot worse. I was so terrified, but right at that moment my mom called me and I convinced him to let go so I could pick up, I answered and told him she said I needed to come home because I didn’t clean my room. He ended up driving me home and was grumbling the whole way back about how I was a frigid bitch. The minute he pulled near my house I was finally able to get out and I ran in and told my mom everything. She said she had a really bad feeling too and that’s why she called and said I needed to come home. I don’t know if he really would’ve hurt me, but I’d like to think that her intuition saved my hide.

Title: I've been a truck driver for a few months, I've seen some weird things...

When I first took this job to be an over-the-road trucker, I thought it would be really exciting. I thought I'd get to travel the country and see the sights and come home with stories to tell my friends and family. I was right. This job is exciting, but I soon found that I'm better off not sharing these stories with anyone close to me. Not because I don't trust them, but because...I'm worried they wouldn't believe me.

Let me back up. My name is Brittany, I'm 22 years old, and I've been driving with a rather large company for a few months now, that I won't name, due to obvious reasons. Ever since my training ended and I got my own truck to start solo, I've seen some pretty weird shit. When you're driving the Loneliest Road in America, yes that's it's real name, in the middle of nowhere, Nevada, things can start to get to you. I suppose it was only a matter of time before I saw something, out in the desert at nearly midnight.

I still had another hour to the nearest truck stop, and blasting the freezing cold air against my face was all I could do to keep myself from dozing off at the wheel.

Irresponsible, I know, but until you work this job you don't understand how much lax comes with it. I was driving this highway, in the desert, in the pitch blackness of a cold summer night, when suddenly something runs out in the road in front of me. Before I can even react, it's gone across the other side into the bushes. I barely got a good look at it, but I could've sworn it looked like a large, white dog, faster than any dog I've ever seen. I tried to just ignore it and keep driving. I see animals crossing the road at night all the time, it didn't seem like anything to get worked up about.

Not even a minute later I feel my truck lurch to the left and into the other lane. I quickly try to swerve and correct it, and easily step on the brake so I don't wreck. It can be easy to jackknife an 80,000 pound metal death machine. I slow it down and regain control. I look for the nearest pullover spot so I can see what the hell just hit my rig, and see if there's any damage. Once I find a spot and turn off, hit my brakes and hop out, I walk around to the other side and see a large dent in the side of my trailer.

"What the fuck...?" I say to myself, as I walk over to inspect the side of the trailer. Its a huge dent, at least 5 feet wide and tall. No real shape to it, just a general dent. I can't imagine what could have hit me. My first thought was maybe a boulder rolled down from the side of the hill and smashed into me, but I didn't think I was driving next to any hills or mountains. As far as I knew, it was flat desert.

I hear the sound of dirt crunching under footfall behind me and I turn around. My breath catches in my throat and my stomach drops as I see something standing not 50 feet away from me. It's large, menacing, and white. I can't even find the words to describe what this...thing looked like.

It looked like a very large dog, and that's a stretch. It stood on two short, stout legs, with long forearms reaching down past its knees. It's shoulders were broad and heaving, as if it had just ran a marathon. Its head was mostly shaped like a wolf, with a large snout filled with razor sharp teeth bared in a snarl, saliva dripping from it's maw. It's jet black eyes bore right through me, filled with hatred and hunger. I couldn't move, I was frozen in place, this creature stood between me and my only salvation; my truck. We stared at one another for a moment until I broke the silence.
"You are one ugly motherfucker." I said.

It snarled at me, then, very unexpectedly, it turned and walked away slowly using all four of it's limbs, receding into the bushes and into the night.

I stood there for what felt like several minutes, wondering if it would jump out and feed on my flesh at any moment. It never came back. I ran around the front of my truck and jumped inside, locking the door quickly and flooring it, as fast as you can floor an 18-wheeler, which is not at all. Soon I was back on the highway and barreling down it as if my life depended on it. For a while it felt like it did. Within a half hour I found myself at the truck stop and shut down for the night. Sleep was difficult that night, I was certain every noise I heard was that damn creature returning. Luckily, the night went on without another incident.

I have more stories to tell, but this is getting long so I think I'll stop here. Remember guys, be careful out there on the road, you never know what else is out there with you.

Back in 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first to set foot on the moon, and the last to be Gene Cernan in 1972. It is now 2020, almost 50 years later. About a week ago, I was using my ham radio and was scanning through different frequencies to find one that I thought were interesting, I came across one that was just light static, I proceeded to change the channel, but as I turned the knob, I heard a faint sound of a zipper cross the static. “Hello?” I said attentively. 
“Is anyone there?”. I heard the iconic beep from the transmissions end, of NASA back in 1960.
My heart started pounding. “Am I talking to an astronaut?”. I yipped
“Yes” someone croaked.
“Are you on the international space station??” I asked surprised. 
“No”
“They left me here” 
“They left you?, where?” I mumbled. The static coming from my radio became more prominent and I couldn’t understand anything. I adjusted the antenna then the static lowered progressively. “Where did they leave you?” I continued.
“Here”
“Where is here?”
“On the lunar surface”
“Great joke” I laughed. He began to cry and said
“ I need you to contact mission control, you are the first person I’ve talked to in 10 years”.
My lips went numb. “How is this possible?”
“We haven’t been to the moon since 1972” I said confused.
“Look kid, there is a lot that you don’t know, just call them” he asked irritated. 
“Give me proof” 
“I’ve diverted all power to communications, flight navigation systems are down, I can use the MESA camera outside the lander”
“Ok” I said confused. About five minutes later, he asked how I could send it, I replied by saying through a satellite. He sent it, the pictures showed his battered up space suit with a shattered sun shield. 
“ I’ll-..... I’ll call them” I stuttered in shock. 
“Please, no” he cried.
“Excuse me?” I asked.
“No....NOOOO!!!!!” He screamed. Whatever he was using to call had fallen over and I heard gurgling as the helmet’s visor cracked and the metal bent. I heard an echoed whisper before the frequency fell back to a calm static.

Title: My wife has been missing for 15 years- until she called my phone out of the blue.
Author: u/None

Link: https://reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/12s99dk/my_wife_has_been_missing_for_15_years_until_she/

I don't like to talk about what happened 15 years ago. I don't even like to think about the fact that on January 7th 2008, Sarah Collins, beloved member of the community left home to run an errand and was then never seen again. It was a huge case back then. Everyone seemed to want to know what happened to her, but no one was more desperate for answers than I was.

Sarah and I had been married for five years. I knew as soon as I met her that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. She had one of those smiles that just lit up a room. That's why it was so hard to believe that such a beautiful, successful woman had seemingly disappeared.

They hadn't even recovered her body. 15 years later and they still didn't have a shred of evidence. Not a tire track, or even a fingerprint. Nothing. The police put out an appeal, but no one came forward. Somehow, not a single person had seen her. It was like she had just vanished without a trace.

I think about Sarah a lot. I could never quite bring myself to take down the photos of her from around the house. Sarah's bright face still smiles down at me from every room. There's one photo of her, from our wedding day that I really love. Looking at it is like looking straight at her. It captured her perfectly.

Two days ago, I found myself staring at it, really getting lost in the details. Her eyes, the way the corners of her mouth were lifting into a smile, the small dimple on her left cheek. I was looking at it so intently that I almost didn't notice the phone ringing.

It was the landline phone, which was odd, as no one ever called me on the landline anymore. It was all mobiles nowadays. When I looked at the Caller ID, it was an unknown number. I shrugged, and picked it up anyway. It was probably just the bank, calling to confirm something.

The call took a moment to connect, but when it did, I heard a strange rustling sound on the other end of the line. "Hello?" I wasn't in the mood for any prank callers. "Is anyone there? Hello?"

"Daniel? Daniel, thank goodness I finally reached you." The voice on the other end of the line was a woman's voice, shaking and breathless. "Daniel, it's me. It's Sarah. Are you there?"

When I heard her name, it was like my heart had stopped beating for a moment. Sarah. My Sarah. But that was impossible. Sarah had gone missing 15 years ago. Whoever this was, it was not my wife.

"I don't know who you are, but you're not Sarah," I hissed into the phone, coldly. "Stop calling this number." I had dealt with a lot of these calls, especially when Sarah first went missing. Con artists, fraudsters, anyone who wanted to manipulate a grieving husband. I knew none of them were my wife.

"No, no, Daniel, wait. Wait, you have to listen to me. It's me. Sarah! You have to believe me." She was sounding shrill and desperate now, even a little hysterical. The lengths that people go to in order to sell a lie is astonishing.

"Why are you doing this?" I asked, angrily. "It's been 15 years since my wife disappeared. What do you want from me?" For a moment, the woman on the other end of the line didn't respond. I was beginning to think that the call had disconnected, when she finally spoke.

"Daniel, please! It's me. It's your wife, Sarah," the woman begged. "I'm telling the truth! It's me!" She continued to plead, but I'd had enough. I wasn't going to listen to this liar anymore.

"Don't call this number again," I firmly told her, hanging up. I thought that would do it. She wouldn't be likely to call me again. I assumed it was all over.

The next day, I had asked a friend to help me repair my plumbing system. He was a good friend, I'd known him since college. He had been there for me when Sarah disappeared, getting me through it.

We were both taking a break, catching up on the important events in each other's lives, when my landline phone began to ring again. "Sorry, I have to take this. It might be important," I said, getting up from my seat and making my way to the phone.

I noticed that the call was coming from an unknown number, just as it had the day before. I didn't make a connection right away. After all, it could have just been the bank this time around.

I picked up the phone, and I heard the same rustling sound. It was unsettling, in a strange way. I almost felt like I had heard it before. I just couldn't put my finger on it.

"Hello?" I was already beginning to get a good idea of what this call was, and I wasn't happy about it. "I told you not to call this number."

"Daniel? Daniel, thank goodness I finally reached you." The very same words that she had said the day before. "Daniel, it's me. It's Sarah. Are you there?" It was undoubtedly the same woman.

"I don't have the time for this," I hissed into the phone. "I know you're not Sarah. Stop calling me." I hung up the call and walked back to my friend, who looked confused.

"Who was that?" he asked me. "I heard you saying Sarah's name. Is everything okay?"

"It was some prank caller, trying to pretend to be Sarah," I told him, rolling my eyes. "I thought that I had left it all behind. I even changed my phone number. I don't know how this woman got hold of my new one."

"Pretending to be Sarah?" my friend echoed. "That's really strange. Did you tell anyone about it, like the police?"

"No." I shake my head. "There's no need. It's just someone trying to cause a bit of drama. They probably want money, or something like that." I made it clear that was the end of the conversation. I didn't want to continue talking about it, bringing up harmful reminders of the past.

I woke up the next day, not expecting to get any more calls from the unknown number. I made it very clear that I wouldn't be participating in her charade. However, I was quickly proven wrong.

As soon as I started to walk downstairs for a glass of water, the phone rang again. I thought about letting it ring, but I had a better idea. I was going to issue a much stronger warning to the caller, even threaten to get the police involved if the calls wouldn't stop. That would scare her, I was certain of it.

I picked up the phone, hearing the very same eerie rustling. I couldn't explain it, but it made a shiver run up my spine. Finally, the call connected.

It was just the same as the other times, the same pathetic monologue. "Daniel? Daniel, thank goodness I finally reached you." Maybe it was even a recorded message "Daniel, it's me. It's Sarah. Are you there?"

"If you don't stop calling this number, I'll have no choice but to involve the police," I told the caller. "This is harassment. If you want money, try conning someone else."

Before I could even give the woman on the other line a chance to answer, I hung up the call. Hopefully this would show her that she wouldn't be manipulating me. I could see right through her elaborate scam. I was sure that my warning would stop the calls coming in.

I was so sure of myself that when I was woken by a loud, persistent ringing sound the next morning, I didn't even think to connect it to the unknown number calls.

I first assumed it was my alarm, waking me up, but when I turned to look, I saw that the alarm hadn't gone off yet. That was when I reached the conclusion that it was the landline phone.

I rushed down the stairs, wanting to tell the caller that I would be taking police action, wanting to catch out the desperate scammer. Fortunately, I got down there in time, and picked up the phone.

Holding it to my ear, I heard that creepy rustling that I had become familiar with. It still made my heart beat faster, just for the few seconds until the call connected.

"Daniel? Daniel, thank goodness I finally reached you." The usual message of hysteria came through the phone. I was well used to hearing it by now. "Daniel, it's me. It's Sarah. Are you there?"

"I gave you a warning, I said that if you called again, I would be taking legal action," I spoke into the phone, loudly so that whoever was on the other side would be sure to hear me. "You've gone too far now. I have to do something about this."

I waited for the woman to respond. "Daniel? No, no, it's me. I'm not lying to you. I would never lie to you. Daniel, it's me, Sarah. Your wife, it's me." I can't stand the high pitched whine of her voice.

"You're not Sarah," I told her, bitterly. "I know you're not Sarah. I will be taking action. Goodbye." I hung up the call for the final time and placed the phone back.

I know that woman wasn't Sarah. I know for a fact she wasn't. I know it, because, on January 7th 2008, Sarah Collins, beloved member of the community was killed. And I was the one who killed her.

Sarah was an incredibly beautiful woman. I couldn't believe my luck when she first started showing interest in me. I didn't exactly have a lot of experience when talking to women, and I was ecstatic that someone like Sarah had chosen someone like me.

I loved her, for every single second of our marriage. I loved her, even when I found out that she was cheating on me. I had accidentally stumbled across a string of romantic messages between Sarah and one of her co-workers. She was planning to leave me for him.

Sarah, my Sarah was planning to leave me for him. I couldn't have that. She was so beautiful, so bright, so full of life. I couldn't lose her. I just couldn't lose her.

So I killed her. I didn't have to think about it for long. It was the only way that she would be mine, only mine forever. If she was dead, she would never leave me. She would always be my Sarah.

When the police arrived, I made up an elaborate lie that she had gone out to run an errand and never come home. That very same lie ended up on headlines of the national news.

I didn't know if I would even get away with it, but a year passed, and then another year, and then another. 15 years passed, and no one ever saw through me.

I was about to walk back upstairs, when I heard a small tapping at the window. *Click. Click.* That was the sound of the window opening, and that's when I heard it.

Rustling, right here in my own house. Rustling that paralysed me with fear and sent my mind into a state of panic.

Then I heard her.

"Daniel? Daniel, thank goodness I finally reached you." The voice was coming from inside the house now. "Daniel, it's me. It's Sarah. Are you there?"

Title: I’m stuck in a 2020 time loop, watching the world end over and over.

I’m stuck in a time loop.  Over and over again, I live the same 4 months until the world ends and I die.  Then I wake up and live it again.

Every time, I wake up on November 3rd, 2020.  The next 2 ½ months are plagued with the escalation of already high partisan tensions, resulting from a heavily contested election.  The bias media heavily fuels the tensions.  I’ve lived the same 4 months for over 3 years now, and I still can’t tell you who won.

The nation erupts on January 20th, as two people claim the presidency of the most powerful country in the world.  Both sides have half the nation backing them up, even the military splits.  January 20th is the day the war starts.

By early February, the civil war becomes a world war, as every major nation takes sides.  For the next month, the deadliest battles in human history erupt all over the globe.  The brunt of it all happens right here in my homeland.

The first time I died was at the end of February.  I’ll admit that I chose my side and joined in the war.  I was shot in the head. 

The second time, I thought I could ride the war out, but my apartment building caught fire.  I had the choice to burn to death or jump 23 stories to my death.  I jumped. 

The third time I moved elsewhere, still intending to ride the war out.  I can’t tell you who fires the first nuclear missile, but one hit my city before anyone can flee.  I died in the blast.

The fourth time, I fled the city beforehand, Just to die a far worse death from radioactive fallout.  

I’ve tried everything.  I’ve moved to different locations and tried different strategies, just to die another horrible death.  I’ve been blasted to pieces, hit with an RPG, burned to death, cooked to death by cancerous radiation, murdered by looters, and even was once ravaged by a bear while trying to survive in the wilderness.  I’ve killed myself too, just to wake back up on November 3rd.

I’m convinced that my only way out of the time loop is to somehow survive.  The furthest I’ve made it is March 3rd, 2021.  I’m not sure if any humans survive much longer than that.  

I’m making plans for my next survival attempt.  This is my warning.  I hope you do better at surviving than I do.

Edit:  January 6th, 2021. 

I hope you can see by now that I was not joking, this is the beginning.  My plans are made, are yours??

Good luck

Title: My husband stuck it in crazy.
Author: u/shygirlturnedsassy

I met Brandon a little over two years ago. We met at a friend’s party and I was quite taken with him, almost immediately. His chin and cheekbones looked like they had been carved by a gifted sculptor who felt like showing off. And the fact that he was a good conversationalist, effortlessly charming and had an arrogant glint in his eyes certainly didn’t help matters. I fell. I fell hard. He told me he was crazy about me too and less than a year later, we were married.

Yes, I know what you’re thinking. That it was too early, far too early. And you’re right. Except I didn’t realize it at the time. Being lost in the fun-house of the so called “romantic stage” made me brush aside my friends’ advice when they told me I was rushing into this. I was happy and in love. What did my friends and family know?

However, about a year into our marital bliss, I began to……… notice things. Brandon suddenly got into the habit of dropping by at the gym for a quick workout just before coming home from work. We used to always shower together when we got home, but now, on most days of the week, he had already showered at the gym. He said it was because he was sweaty from the aforementioned “workout” . He also began taking business trips much more frequently. He was on the phone a lot, almost always in his study and would jump if I ever walked in on those rare occasions when the door wasn’t locked. I came to the same conclusion that you just did, and decided to hire a private detective.

Brandon exceeded my expectations. He was sleeping with not one, not two but six different women. I saved the picture the detective sent me. That night when my husband came home, much later than usual and after saying something about his boss being a jackass, he fell asleep next to me. I didn’t confront him. I decided to let this go on for a while. Because just underneath the anger, I felt genuine and morbid curiosity. I wanted to know just how far he would take this façade.

In the weeks that followed, Brandon’s lies became more and more creative. He had scratch marks on his shoulders because “ he slipped and fell at work just as his coworker was opening a drawer and the edges of the drawer scratched his skin”. He reeked of women’s perfume because “Laura from marketing does not understand the meaning of the word ‘moderation’ and she was a hugger”. All of these cock and bull stories were told with a perfectly calm demeanor and while looking me straight in the eye. His knack for mendacity was admirable. We did keep having sex. A cheating whore he was but he did have a great body and phenomenal love making skills. And I have needs so, why the hell not!

I had the private detective film his interaction with his …..lady friends. The ones that took place in public of course. All six of those women seemed quite charmed with him, just as I had been. But one of them, a young girl, probably in her early to mid twenties, looked downright obsessed with him. The way she smiled at him, fawned over him, pulled her chair closer to him and kissed him even in a crowded resturaunt, the way she just didn’t want to let go of him when he was dropping her off at her place, her feelings were certainly a lot more intense that those of the others. I’m willing to bet that the scratch marks had come from her. Her name was Svetlana.

Soon after, Brandon’s devil may care demeanor began giving way to irritation and anxiety. He often sounded angry when talking on the phone. The person on the other end seemed to really be getting on his nerves. At times his phone would ring nonstop. We’d be at the dinner table and it would ring, he’d answer, tell the person that they’d talk later and it would ring immediately after he’d hung up. This would go on till he had turned it off. My suspicions about who it could be were confirmed when one evening I heard him say in an angry whisper “it’s over Lana!”.

The poor thing! But I couldn’t totally blame Brandon for wanting to get away from her. She did seem like he obsessive kind.

I couldn’t help but wonder.

A few day later, I decided to “run into” Svetlana at the mall. By now the detective had been told that his services were no longer required, but not before I had learned the details of Svetlana’s schedule The poor girl deserved to know the truth about the man she clearly loved. I introduced myself as Brandon’s wife. Two harmless little words that when put together, made her look like a bomb had gone off inside her head. I told her I felt for her. That neither her nor I deserved to lied to this way. That I would have been jealous of her, had she been the only other woman, but how can I be jealous of so many women. That last thing I said, made her eyes go even wider and got a “w…what??” out of her.

I proceeded to tell her all about Brandon’s other affairs. I showed her the pictures, gave her names and told her she deserves better than this. That she should move on. Then I walked away. All I had to do now was wait.

The phone call came on a Friday afternoon. You see, Brandon hadn’t come home the night before and being the concerned wife that I was, I called his friends, his office, his parents, his gym. Everyone. As it turns out, his secretary also didn’t show up to work that day. The police officer told me to come down to the station immediately. When I got there, I learned that my husband and his secretary had been found dead in the secretary’s apartment. Their skulls brutally crushed. I broke down. I allowed the anger over Brandon’s betrayal to finally surface and my screams and tears made the cops think I was grief stricken. No acting was needed.

As the investigation progressed, Brandon’s indiscretions became known. The cops asked if I knew about them and I confessed that I did, but that my Brandon was just a sex addict. He told me so. He loved me and the other women were just objects to him. We were going to seek counseling. Interestingly, one Svetlana Lebedev, one of the women Brandon had been having affairs with, had suddenly gone missing. She had quit her job and vacated her apartment, the day before Brandon was killed.

Now I’m wondering if I should leave town. If Svetlana would come after me next, just for daring to be married to Brandon. Although I don’t think I have much to worry about. Because as crazy as she is, I think I might be crazier……….

Title: I was finally able to get out of my shitty marriage
Author: u/None

When my husband first hit me, I wasn’t surprised. I wasn’t even hurt, at least not in the physical sense. I had been expecting it for a while, everytime a muscle in his jaw twitched or his breathing shallowed. A short fuse ready to explode.

At first it was words murmured under his breath, a disapproving shake of his head. Then it was the frustration, along with an impatience reserved for children who don’t know better. Or an untrained pet.

The way he spoke to me slowly became more and more hateful, his vile words often puncturing me like knives. The worst came when he was drunk, which was pretty often, but he wasn’t half as brave when he was hungover. He never apologized, instead blaming his bad temper on work related stress, saying I only added to it.

Basically, he was a poor fucking excuse for a man.

The first time he actually swung his fist, he punched a hole in our wall, all because I accidentally bought the wrong kind of beer. For days, the hole stayed untouched, wide like a yawning mouth. Every time I looked at it, I knew that I was next in line. As for the beer, he still drank all of it.

At one point, he even tasked me to patch up the hole, either by my own hand or with my own money. A vase flew by my head when I called him crazy. I learned after that not to talk back, even if it didn’t change anything.

Not long after, when my husband’s fist got tired of plaster and glass, my flesh sufficed. In a way I was almost offended, how he didn’t consider me first even for this. Always on the backburner, the toy forgotten in the back of the dresser, the ghost that watched things unfold for everyone else.

But you know what the worst part is?  I couldn’t leave him.

See, when I married him, I didn’t do it out of love. I did it out of a need so great that it was almost a tangible thing, threatening to consume me. I was young and very poor, desperate to get out of my parents shabby little house. They wouldn’t miss me anyways, I was one of seven kids they couldn’t feed and much less care for. They probably didn’t even remember me.

Frank - my husband - was a little older than me, a college dropout that had a job as a mechanic. He wasn’t ugly, not necessarily, but girls weren’t throwing themselves at him either. He had a bit of a mean face too, with dark, flat eyes and early onset wrinkles from frowning so much. He was a good kisser, though, I’ll give him that.

We met after my father almost totaled his old pick up truck, bringing it in for repairs he really couldn’t afford. In Frank, I saw an opportunity, and my need overpowered any feelings of warning. We both just settled for each other, unconsciously knowing there wouldn’t be anything better in our shitty little town.

We got married as soon as I graduated highschool, moving in together soon after. Our wedding was about as “romantic” as you’d expect. Small town chapel with all the guests sitting on the groom’s side. His lips tasted like greasy gas station taquitos when we kissed to seal the ceremony.

I got a job waitressing and also helped stock at the supermarket a couple times a week. We were definitely struggling, but our crammed apartment was infinitely better than my childhood “home”. The days began to blend into each other, turning into months and then years.

Those first few years weren’t so bad. They were monotonous, yes, but at least we mostly stayed out of each other’s ways and focused on making enough to pay our bills. He was a heavy drinker like my father, and his party days never really seemed to end. Most nights, he was too drunk to do anything but yell and pass out, with me cleaning up the mess behind him.

Things went to shit when we found out I couldn’t have children. We - and when I say we, I mean just him - had been trying for a while with no luck, and a trip to the doctor brought us clarity. It was out of my control, obviously, and while I was a little sad, I was also infinitely thankful. It was a blessing in disguise.

To him, these news were only a curse. He made sure to always remind me that I was a defective woman, that it had been a mistake to marry me, that he had lost his prime years being with me… blah, blah, blah. He was fucking insufferable, but I did nothing and said nothing when he started fucking younger girls. At least he had left me alone when it comes to… well, that.

I can’t lie and say that I hadn’t dreamed of having a daughter one day. Perhaps if I wound up somewhere much better in life, with a stable job that paid me well enough and the unshakable courage to stand up for myself, I’d run away with my daughter and be the parent I desperately needed as a child. I would have named her Cassie, and it would have been us against the world.

I was stupid enough to dare to hope. I knew that to bear his child and bring it into this world would be condeming it to a life of suffering. I would never forgive myself for it. I cried often when he wasn’t home, but after a while, I ran out of tears. Life had never been lonelier.

You may think I’m a coward, but I don’t really care. I don’t think I need to reiterate that I couldn’t afford a fucking divorce, and going to bed with bruises was better than sleeping in alleyways reeking of piss. I still had some sense of self worth.

Still, I had my way of dealing with things. My own dirty little secret.

During the day, I was the “perfect” wife, placid and quiet and always of service. I packed his lunch in the mornings, along with extra strong coffee to nurse his hangovers. I kept the house impeccable, paid bills on time and learned how to cover up the evidence of his violence on my body. I had deep, teeth shaped grooves on my wrists from holding in my screams, so I always wore long sleeves. I learned early on that making any sort of noise would only makes things worse for me.

Nobody suspected a thing, perhaps because they didn’t care to look to closely.

At night, as I lay awake in bed, I thought of carnage. All the violent ways I wanted payback, be it by my hand or not. In reality, I could never actually bring myself to get physical like that. I hadn’t thought it possible for me to even conjure such scenarios, but years of repressed anger and hatred can really bring out the worst in a person. It all had to go somewhere.

These thoughts followed me into dreams, where my imagination ran free. I dreamt of graceful arcs of blood spurting out of his jugular, staining our eggshell walls. How his large intestine would spool out of his sliced abdomen like unused yarn. Snapping one of his rib bones to pick meat off my teeth.

And suddenly, I wasn’t myself in those dreams. There was a creature, one so alike me, yet so different at the same time. At first it was hard for me to discern its features, but it became clearer with every night that passed.

It had my hair, a dirty blonde that I always hated, but it was matted and falling off in chunks, exposing bald craters. It had no eyes or nose or ears, but the mouth took up most of the space needed for those, jutting out like an animal’s maw. It was long and spindly, and when I dreamt of it crawling atop my husband, it reminded me of an arachnid closing in on a fly. It was a beautiful nightmare.

The sight of it felt familiar, too, like it had always been there; An extension of my flesh that had been waiting for me to unearth it at the right time. A projection of the unfathomable strength and brutality I wished I possessed during daytime. So, naturally, I latched on to it, addicted to the nocturnal rush of adrenaline. Nobody could take this carnage away from me.

I began to wake up feeling more refreshed, more alive than I’d ever been, like I had been practicing lots of self care and catching up on years worth of rest. I was sleeping a lot better, drifting through my day with ease and a syrupy sweet smile plastered on my face. Someone at work even told me I was glowing, asking if I was pregnant, to which I bluntly responded with “I’m infertile.”

He didn’t think it was funny, but the look on his face was priceless. Not that I cared what he or anyone else thought of me for that matter. Making friends wasn’t really a priority, given that I was on survival mode 24/7.

The crazy thing is, I did feel like I wasn’t alone anymore. There was an overwhelming sense of peace that had suddenly flooded me, and at the very back of my mind there was a reassuring voice that I couldn’t quite hear but still understood. The beast fed off of my hatred and rage, deepening my thirst for revenge.

At times, I thought perhaps I was losing it, but would that really be so terrible? I would have welcomed living a muddled reality where I had the upper hand.

For two weeks, my husband even kept his hands off of me. He avoided me at all costs instead of berating me for every little thing. He slept away instead of bringing girls to the house. The bruises on my body were healing, turning a soft yellow and red against my pale skin. Things seemed to be okay, for once.

That was, until the night one of his many skanks fed him some new drug, an amphetamine of sorts, and he came home cross eyed and drooling like an animal. It was the middle of the night when he barged into our room, bellowing some nonsense that my barely awake mind couldn’t comprehend. At the moment, I thought it more annoying than frightening.

I got up and tried to coax him into calming down, to get into the bed and get some sleep, but he wouldn’t listen. He swung his big, beefy arms as I tried to reach for him, smacking me across the face in the process. His pupils were wide and dark, swallowing his irises in a vortex of nothingness. His breath alone could light a raging fire with a single spark. If only I had thought to get a lighter or a box of matches. What a more poetic way to go than by the cleansing flame?

For the first time in all our time together, I thought *enough*. In a blind act of bravery, I shoved him and he lost his balance, falling onto the mirror that hung on the door and shattering it. When his mind registered what I had just done, he looked at me with an animalistic rage. He didn’t even seem to notice his arm was bleeding, full of tiny cuts.

We were both tense, our bodies coiled like springs about to snap. I felt powerful in that moment, but it was a feeling that quickly died down. He was the first to move, and he was so fast I was barely able to react. From one second to the next,  he was holding a shard of glass and advancing on me. Once more, he had all control over me, snatching all that power I felt for even a fraction of a second.

He swung wildly, screaming “I’m going to kill you!”, all while I scurried back quickly, barely out of reach of the shard. In my haste, I tripped over a pillow and fell backwards for what felt like an eternity. Time slowed down, until suddenly there was a sickening crack at the back of my skull.

Then there was only darkness. I had been snuffed out from existence in an instant, quietly, without so much as a gasp.

Or so I thought.

I wasn’t sure how long I was passed out for, but I woke up to a *squelch* and the acrid, coppery smell of blood. My vision swam, and I lied there on the floor as I tried to blink away the splitting headache. A movement on the bed caught my eye and I stared hard, trying to make out what I was seeing. A long, thin arm sliced through the air, sharpening into a right angle as a bloody hand gripped the lower edge of the bed frame.

My eyes followed the pale flesh and I saw a flash of pink stained teeth, long and thin as fingers. On the walls, large crimson Rorschach stains. The image was so familiar that I thought for a moment I was in a dream again, though a more vivid one. The pain grounded me, as did the memory of what had caused me to pass out. Breathing mechanically, I found some strength within me and slowly sat up. There was more blood under me and the back of my head felt slick and warm.

I placed a hand down to keep myself upright, but instead of feeling the wooden floor, there was something tough and sinewy. The bed creaked and I looked up, my mind unable to process what was in front of me. The creature from my dreams smiled, which looked weird given its elongated mouth. It was covered in blood and gore, but seemed intact. It had my husband pinned underneath Its body, one long hand pressed against his chest. He was unconscious, bruised and battered, with a couple bites here and there.

Beside the creature, something long uncoiled off the side of the bed and snaked on the floor, underneath my hand and still going. It was a sickening white, pale blue and purple in color. One end seemed to be connected to the creature’s stomach, while the other…. Instinctively, I reached a hand up towards the back of my head, where the edge of my nightstand hit my skull. The other end was firmly attached to the nape of my neck, going into a small, fleshy crater that should have been my demise.

That’s when it hit me. *An umbilical chord.*

The creature had freed itself from the dark womb of my inconscious mind, out into reality. My dreams were the gestation, every night the creature growing stronger. I nourished it, fed it and even came to love it. I was a mother, despite what I had been told. I was not broken, or useless or any of the things my husband called me.  I was the one in control of my life and my body.

I moved, and the creature followed. I raised a hand, and it did the same. It mirrored me, like a child learnig a parent’s mannerisms, despite the fact that it had no eyes to see me. *Love is blind*, or so they say. I knew this creature would do anything for me, and I for it.

The creature helped me up and steadied me on my feet. Underneath, my husband groaned a little, yet remained unconcious. Both of us looked down at my husband’s prone body, detached. The hindrance that stood between us and the life we wanted. Oh, how glorious it would be.

Now that we had each other, the next step was to get rid of the obstacle.

Hours later, there was no more of Frank. At least, nothing discernible. We reenacted so many of those violent fantasies, but as much as I wanted to hear him scream, we couldn’t alert the neighbors. His vocal chords were severed first, but the look of abject, mute horror and agony on his face was worth it.

We left before morning came, catching a brand new day to start a new life. We needed sustenance for the road, so we ate and we drank as much as we could. By the time they found his bones, they would be bleached by the sun, poised on the bed pathetically, if not a little melancholic. I made sure no one would come looking for a while.

It was a fair trade, after all; One man’s nightmare being a woman’s dream. It’s what I deserved.
