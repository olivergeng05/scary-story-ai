I (14M) have a bone disease known as Multiple Hereditary Exostoses (MHE). It causes benign bone tumors to grow everywhere on my body. Although they aren't cancerous, they are very painful when they are near a nerve. 

A lot of these tumors have grown in my knees, fingers and ribs. You can probably guess there are a lot of nerves and muscles there that can be pinched and pierced. It hurts quite a lot. I am constantly at level 5 pain (scale of 1-10). I can only walk for up to 2 minutes, I can't write (with a pen, if I couldnt type this post wouldnt exist lol) and I'm basically in agony.

We have decided I will go for surgery to saw off some of the most painful tumors in my knee. Hopefully this will restore my ability to walk. The doctors have also decided we should remove 2 of my ribs, which have cracked due to the tumors. They'll be replaced with metal I think.

~~There is a 20% chance of death with all these very complicated procedures, and of course a chance this surgery doesn't change anything, or even makes it worse. Rolling a less than 6 sided dice to determine if I live or die.~~ [Read below edits]

But to be honest, I don't really care what happens in this surgery.

If it works, great, I can walk again. If it fails and my condition stays the same/deteriorates, I've adapted to this disease enough. I can probably handle a few turns for the worst. And if I die, well, I suppose then there is no more pain.

My friends say it is wrong for me to feel okay about dying. I'm not suicidal, I wouldn't kill myself if I had the chance. But I don't exactly care if I die at this point. It's in fate's hands at this point.

Comment anything, in 7 hours, I'll be on the operating table that'll determine my destiny.

EDIT: Soon about to enter the operating room. Welp, this is it. Let's see our fate

EDIT 2; I'M ALIVE, LES GOOOO. Recovery pain's a bitch but otherwise, I'm fine

EDIT 3: Here is a post showing an extremely large update. https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/tsroac/update_3_weeks_ago_i_might_have_died_now_im_alive/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

EDIT 4: Hey, I've recently turned 16. Just wanted to give an update on my life.

I'm still sick, unfortunately, that's the sad part of chronic illnesses, but... that's alright. I've coped with it, and I thank you for reading this, for whatever reason, years later. 

Also, I know that the percentages my younger self wrote was absolute nonsense according to a few commentors. Apologies, I was a 14 year old who was panicking because of a surgery. My odds of survival were likely much higher than I anticipated back then. Still, this post really did portray how I felt before a possibly life-changing surgery.

Once again, thanks for taking the time to read this really, really, old post. I hope you enjoyed my story.

From this whole situation, it feels like you woke up as a child from screams, you run out and you understand that your drunk mother has gone crazy and went to fight with the neighbors. You stand and look at it, you feel, shame, fear and you are afraid to say something, because she will kick you at home

It's honestly the most exciting thrill that I often daydream about and look forward to. I wake up pretty thirsty and bloated though, lol.

UPDATE: I'm going to pull this off again sometime in the next couple days. I'll try to document it with some pictures of all the glory!!!!

[UPDATE 2 with pics!!!](https://imgur.com/a/XWDRRam)

I ordered a large pizza tonight instead of a medium because of a coupon, but I went with the thin crust. I like regular crust wayyy better!!! After I polished off the 8 hot wings, I had to tap out after 4.5 pizzas..I was just too full. Anyways, thanks for all the love :)

Probably won't be doing many more of these, but, glad some of you enjoyed partaking in my secret plate night indulgences. 

Love yourself. Choose to be happy. Even if it means not sharing with your wife :)

#Edit: To all the profile-lurkers, my husband is no longer a moderator, and has a (real) job now FYI
 
my husband refuses to look for a job even though I think it would be good for him (And we could use the additional income), but he just says he’s, “got too much on his plate already”. 


That being monitoring these stupid subreddits. And Everytime I bring it up he claims what he’s doing is unpaid labor similar to that of a homemaker. But he doesn’t clean or cook or do any of that the way he used to. He just monitors his stupid subreddits. I don’t know what to do.


Sometimes I want to leave him because I believe I may not be able to reach him.

I'm sitting here with my wife, waiting for full scale war to begin. We have no means to leave country and no where to go when shit hits the fan. And from this perspective every previous problems in my life now feel so... meaningless, it's 2022 in Europe, but here it's 31st of August 1939 here in Ukraine. 

I'm not scared even anymore, I'm just tired of this waiting. 

God help our soldiers, and curse those fashists.

Edit: 1) I do think of either fleeing with my wife and son (yes I didn't note that i have a pre school kid) or taking them to safety , but kid greatly reduces mobility, and my wife still don't want to flee right now (she believes in our army)

2) Thanks for rewards, and support, but i honestly, Reddit carma is on the bottom list of stuff i care.

3) it's 2:31 am here, and i have to try to catch some sleep.

4) i never thought, but warm words kinda helped me, thank you all, you are the best.

5) Слава Україні! Я вірю в хлопців на фронті.

Edit. Its 6:26. We are packed. Kid is sleeping. On early morning, we woke from 2 explosions. War has started. 

We are preparing to evacuate. We are being striken by missiles.

Title: I found out that my boyfriend of 2 years is married and has kids, I'm showing myself to his family tomorrow at his church.

Throwaway because I don't want my followers to see this. I'm just so confused right now and need to talk to somebody.

I've been seeing this guy "Adam, 32" for 2 years. He's from another town but visits me on weekends. I never met his family, friends or been to his town. I know that he works at the church and he takes pride in that.

3 weeks ago, I found out that he's actually married and has 2 kids, I was devastated and in a state of disbeleif but most of all, I was mad, especially after I confirmed this via his wife's social media account. We're still talking and I haven't broke up with him yet...I planned and decided to show myself to his family on Sunday at his church and let them know that he used me and took advantage, I plan on ending it right there and then. I'm currently in his town staying at a hotel, I'm doing this tomorrow and no one knows except myself, He's still texting me lies thinking that I'm stupid or ignorant. I feel terrible but something's pushing me to do this. Don't know if it's anger or feeling bad for his wife and kids..I just...I'm not gonna lie I'm worried this might back fire at me but at this point I have nothing to lose, I just feel like I need to get my respect and dignity back after being lied to and fooled for 2 years.

Title: Tomorrow, I'm going to ruin his life

I have been with him for 3 years now. We planned on getting married when our lives settle down. I wanted to start a family with him, I loved him more than anyone else in this world. I've sacrificed so much for him, moved away from my home, turned down jobs so I could stay with him, and stood by his side as he started to go back to school. I gave him my world.

And he cheats on me.

I found out over a month ago. The scumbag got cocky, and I found out he was cheating on me, with 2 different women. One is a TA at his university, the other his best friend's girlfriend. I am livid. I write this post choking back venom. I loved him so much. He was my world, but now he will be the world I burn to nothing but ash.

I pay for everything since he quit his job last year to go to school. I was more than happy to help him, I make enough to support us both. The only upside is the student loans are in his name with no connection to me. It will hurt to push the scumbag out to sea, but I will survive.

I have held out for a month, enough time to create what I call "The day his world burns" Tomorrow we are hosting a party. I arranged for his family to come, but my family will sadly not be able to make it. I have packed everything valuable already, and the suitcase is in the back of my car. My brother will come during the event tomorrow, to take the car that is in my name that the dirtbag drives to my parent's house. The joint account, which is all my money anyway, is already empty.

The event will be great, and he thinks it's for us to announce our engagement to his family. What will happen in reality is I will announce my departure from his life. I have already taken a job out of state, and have lined up a new place to live. I will start by telling everyone what he is into. The screenshots of him asking his friend's girlfriend to piss on him, and the many other fantasies his degenerate mind came up with will be passed around. I will hand him the notice to vacate, as I have already broken our lease. We need to be out by the end of the month. I will then end off by informing him I have already reported he was sleeping with the TA for one of his classes the previous semester to the university and that I am sad I won't see the fallout from that. His friend also has a message for him that I will deliver, informing him that his friend group never wants to see him again as well.

And with that, I will leave. I will not look back. I will set his life on fire and walk away.

Title: I just found myself actually preparing for the war that may or may not happen in the foreseen future

It's hard to describe. I'm from Ukraine, Dnipro, about 200 km from the warzone that's already there for eight years, and we all here kind of used to the Russian baked shit that happening in the east. However, now everything seems different. I'm genuinely sure that they'll try to cut the whole country in half.  

This situation hits something deep inside, I lost all my friends, all I have is my wonderful sister and grumpy mother. I've never been in an actual fight, I'm just a random copywriter who just lives his life, smokes weed, plays bass, doing dojo and trying to find his second half. Next week I'm going to join the army and soon I'll be dead or become a murderer in order to protect my wonderful sister and my grumpy mother for no reason. Or maybe not.

EDIT: sigh, here we go. They're here, 3 hours driving from our house. I mean actual house.

EDIT 2: (2\23\2022)
- No I'm not in the army, I decided to join volunteer paramedic courses. Thousands of people here helped me to switch toward this direction as well. Thank you all for such warm words. It's hard to keep your head cold these days nomsayin.
- My family shows no will to move from our town so am I.
- On Feb 22 Russian troops invaded Ukraine from the eastern front. After that we have a lot of reports about pinpoint artillery skirmishes from their side, however, I don´t trust anything I see on the web. Hybrid war is based on misinformation so I have to take this into account.
- On Feb 23 Ukrainian government's planning to legalize firearms and declare a state of emergency. The most hilarious part is that we are still on a visa-free regime with Russia. There's no military response or clashes from the Ukrainian side so far.


Is it possible to keep you guys in touch via this thread with editing? Or should I simply make new posts? Or a sub? I've never done such threads before. For those who think that I'm a bot: I will not show any personal credentials to strangers, I'm not 5 years old.

EDIT Feb 24 Kyiv Odessa Dnipro Kharkiv are under attack, we put down two Russians aircrafts, it's 8 am.

ESIT Feb 24 1121AM we put down 4 tanks and 6 aircraft, Russians pushing tanks from south and east, actual combat begins.

EDIT Feb 24 1324PM some say Kherson's fallen, 300k citizens large. Dnipro's quiet, Kyiv is under pressure, Odessa is under pressure.

EDIT Feb 25 1109AM I'm with a volunteer HQ right now, donated blood already, filling supplies, driving people around.

Speaking of the war: they're focusing on Kyiv heavily, bombing civilian buildings, few hospitals were also destroyed, these fucking apes also took Chernobyl's atomic station last night, so we may see the actual apocalypse which I guess may also touch Europe heavily. Guys from EU, I'd recommend you to fresh your memory in terms of radiation civilian protection instructions. Russia broke so many humanistic laws it's indescribable. On the south, we have heavy clashes for ~16 hours at this point. Kharkiv stands still, Dnipro (my town) extremely mobilized and rushed into hot areas.

EDIT Feb 28 I'm volunteering 24/7, constantly rushing between shelters and buying medicine for wounded. Thank God for cryptocurrency. Depression and sleep deprivation. Will go on trenches tomorrow. I'm on territorial defense waiting list, enormous number of volunteers. Russians bombing citizens, 15 dead children so far. Today each Ukrainian is brother and sister. A lot of traitors in high command, special forces working on them [pretty rough](https://twitter.com/IsraelThreads/status/1498359401140396032?s=20&t=L_5GXvIPUWGPY2Xe_tOnQQ) . I have no  energy, 2 days without sleep on crossfit regime. Fuck war. They switched towards airstrikes and artillery today, mainly citizens. Because we're fucking grinding them on land clashes.

EDIT March 06 I was preparing for the war. But how can one be prepared for genocide and nuclear terror? Thousands of civilians are slaughtered like livestock. I'm focusing on wounded in local hospital. Can you imagine the ambient sound of Bosch's triptych? This is life right now. It's fucking hell. Thank you all. If nuking Ukraine means saved people from Europe and the US, guess it's a fair price. The west will not join the war, it's clear by now. We are alone here.

EDIT March 23 Things are sort of getting stabilized. We're slowly surrounding and boiling them in Kyiv upskirts, Mariupol is a tragedy, can't say but civilian casualties may be up to 10k+ there. Google Mizintsev, this sick fuck is responsible for civil bombardment orders. As well as raping, looting, kidnapping, deporting civilians from Mariupol to fucking gulags. My town is under daily bombardments for 6 days, they're launching rockets from Crimea and Kaspian sea. Yesterday they dropped something big, as the report says 2 Urals size combined, that was loud. I left territorial defense forces, because we're basically protecting guys who protect a tree. Waste of time money and resources. No trainings, mainly because it's too many of us wasting time. Now I'm personally focused on vests and helmet manufacturing. It's not possible to get this stuff from Europe (in Ukraine we're out of stock since day 2), so we said fuck it, we'll make our own. So we get 150 tons of armored steel, already made 1000 good vests with dampers and plate carriers nomsaying. A good friend of mine, he's drummer, we've played together for years. He lost his mother, 7yo sister lost her arm and leg, father in coma. That was phosphorus bomb, shelter didn't helped.

Title: $600?!?

$600? Is this supposed to be a fucking joke? Our government refuses to send financial help for months, and then when they do, they only give us $600? The average person who was protected from getting evicted is in debt by $5,000 and is about to lose their protection, and the government is going to give them *$600.?* There are people lining up at 4 am and standing in the freezing cold for almost 12 hours 3-4 times a week to get BASIC NECESSITIES from food pantries so they can feed their children, and they get *$600?* There are people who used to have good paying jobs who are living on the streets right now. There are single mothers *starving themselves* just to give their kids something to eat. There are people who’ve lost their primary bread winner because of COVID, and *they’re all getting $600??*

Christ, what the hell has our country come to? The government can invest billions into *weaponizing space* but can only give us all $600 to survive a global pandemic that’s caused record job loss.
